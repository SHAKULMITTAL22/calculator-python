Feature: API Testing Scenarios

Background:
  Given the API base URL is set to 'http://localhost:3000'
  And the authorization header is set to 'Bearer <token>'
  And the content type is 'application/json'

Scenario: Verify successful integration test execution
  Given the integration test script is available and configured correctly
  When I execute the integration test script
  Then the execution should complete successfully
  And the logs should not contain any errors

Scenario: Verify error handling in integration test
  Given the integration test script is available and configured correctly
  When I introduce a known error in the integration test script
  And I execute the integration test script
  Then the script should catch the error
  And the logs should contain a clear error message

Scenario: Verify Gherkin parsing in integration test
  Given the integration test script is available and configured correctly
  And a valid Gherkin file is prepared
  When I execute the integration test script with the Gherkin file
  Then the script should parse the Gherkin file successfully
  And the logs should not contain any parsing errors

Scenario: Verify handling of iterable objects in integration test
  Given the integration test script is available and configured correctly
  When I introduce an iterable object in the integration test script
  And I execute the integration test script
  Then the script should handle the iterable object successfully
  And the logs should not contain any handling errors

Scenario: Verify performance under load in integration test
  Given the integration test script is available and configured correctly
  And the load testing tool is set up
  When I configure the load testing tool to simulate heavy load
  And I execute the integration test script under the simulated load
  Then the script should complete successfully
  And the performance metrics should be within acceptable thresholds

Scenario: Verify error recovery time in integration test
  Given the integration test script is available and configured correctly
  When I introduce a known error in the integration test script
  And I execute the integration test script
  Then the script should recover from the error within an acceptable time frame

Scenario: Verify resource utilization in integration test
  Given the integration test script is available and configured correctly
  And the resource monitoring tools are set up
  When I execute the integration test script
  Then the script should utilize system resources within acceptable limits
  And the resource utilization metrics should be monitored and compared with predefined thresholds
