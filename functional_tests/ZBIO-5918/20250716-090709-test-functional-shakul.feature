Feature: Testing Integration Test Suite

Background:
  Given the API base URL is set to 'http://localhost:3000'
  And the authorization header is set to 'Bearer <token>'
  And the content type is set to 'application/json'

Scenario: Verify Gherkin Parsing
  Given the integration test suite is set up with Gherkin scenarios
  When I run the integration test suite
  Then the logs should indicate that 6 scenarios were parsed successfully
  And no errors should be thrown during parsing

Scenario: Check for TypeError in generateIntegrationTest
  Given the integration test suite is set up with Gherkin scenarios
  When I run the integration test suite
  Then no TypeError should be logged during the test generation
  And the test should complete successfully

Scenario: Validate Object Iterability
  Given the integration test methods are defined
  When I review the integration test methods
  Then all objects used in integration test methods should be iterable
  And no TypeErrors should be logged during test execution

Scenario: Test Error Handling in Integration Tests
  Given the integration test methods include try-catch blocks for error handling
  When I introduce errors in the integration test methods
  And I run the tests
  Then errors should be caught and logged appropriately
  And the test suite should not fail

Scenario: Performance Testing of Integration Tests
  Given the integration test suite is set up and ready for execution
  When I run the integration test suite multiple times
  Then the time taken for each run should be recorded
  And the average execution time should be within acceptable performance limits

Scenario: Stress Testing of Integration Tests
  Given the integration test suite is set up and ready for execution
  When I increase the number of concurrent tests
  And I run the integration test suite under high load
  Then the integration test suite should handle high load conditions gracefully
  And no failures or performance degradation should occur
