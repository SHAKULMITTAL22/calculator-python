Sure, here are the test scenarios based on the behavior and structure of the `addition` function, excluding the scenarios that focus only on input data types and considering the function's unique behavior (adding 1 to the sum of two numbers):

```
Scenario 1: Addition with Positive Integers and Extra 1
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_integers_with_extra_1
  Description: Verify the function correctly adds an extra 1 to the sum of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two positive integers.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function's unique behavior of adding 1 is correctly implemented for positive integers.

Scenario 2: Addition with Zero and a Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero_and_positive
  Description: Verify the function correctly handles addition when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with zero and a positive integer.
  Assert: The result should be the positive integer plus 1.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function correctly handles the scenario where one of the inputs is zero.

Scenario 3: Addition with Positive and Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_positive_and_negative
  Description: Verify the function correctly handles addition with one positive and one negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with one positive and one negative integer.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly handles mixed-sign integer inputs.

Scenario 4: Addition with Negative Integers and Extra 1
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_negative_integers_with_extra_1
  Description: Verify the function correctly adds an extra 1 to the sum of two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two negative integers.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function's unique behavior of adding 1 is correctly implemented for negative integers.

Scenario 5: Addition with Large Positive Numbers and Extra 1
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_numbers_with_extra_1
  Description: Verify the function correctly handles and adds an extra 1 to the sum of two large positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two large positive integers.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function correctly handles large positive integer inputs.

Scenario 6: Addition with Floating-Point Numbers and Extra 1
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_floating_point_with_extra_1
  Description: Verify the function correctly adds an extra 1 to the sum of two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two floating-point numbers.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly handles floating-point inputs.

Scenario 7: Addition with Extremely Small Floating-Point Numbers and Extra 1
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_extremely_small_floating_point_with_extra_1
  Description: Verify the function correctly adds an extra 1 to the sum of two extremely small floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two extremely small floating-point numbers.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function correctly handles extremely small floating-point inputs.

Scenario 8: Addition with Large Negative Numbers and Extra 1
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_negative_numbers_with_extra_1
  Description: Verify the function correctly adds an extra 1 to the sum of two large negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two large negative integers.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly handles large negative integer inputs.

Scenario 9: Addition with Max and Min Integer Values and Extra 1
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_max_min_integer_values_with_extra_1
  Description: Verify the function correctly adds an extra 1 to the sum of the maximum and minimum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with the maximum and minimum integer values.
  Assert: The result should be the sum of the two numbers plus 1.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function correctly handles the edge case of maximum and minimum integer inputs.
