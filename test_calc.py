Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `addition` method based on the provided function definition and the existing test cases:

```
Scenario 1: Standard Addition with Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_integers
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds two positive integers and correctly adds the extra 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(3, 4)
  Assert: The result should be 9 because 3 + 4 + 2 = 9
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly performs basic addition with positive integers and includes the extra 2 required by the function definition.

Scenario 2: Addition with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(0, 5)
  Assert: The result should be 7 because 0 + 5 + 2 = 7
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly handles zero as one of the operands and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 3: Addition with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_negative_numbers
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(-3, -4)
  Assert: The result should be -5 because -3 + -4 + 2 = -5
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative numbers and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 4: Addition with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_numbers
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(1000000, 2000000)
  Assert: The result should be 3000002 because 1000000 + 2000000 + 2 = 3000002
Validation:
  This test checks that the function can handle large numbers without overflow and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 5: Addition with Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_floating_point
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(3.5, 2.5)
  Assert: The result should be 8.0 because 3.5 + 2.5 + 2 = 8.0
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles floating-point numbers and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 6: Addition with Mixed Types
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_mixed_types
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving mixed types (integer and floating-point).
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(5, 2.5)
  Assert: The result should be 9.5 because 5 + 2.5 + 2 = 9.5
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly handles mixed types and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 7: Addition with Extremely Small Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_extremely_small_floating_point
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving extremely small floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(1e-10, 2e-10)
  Assert: The result should be 3.0000000002e-10 because 1e-10 + 2e-10 + 2 = 3.0000000002e-10
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles extremely small floating-point numbers and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 8: Addition with Large Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_negative_numbers
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving large negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(-1000000, -2000000)
  Assert: The result should be -3000001 because -1000000 + -2000000 + 2 = -3000001
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly handles large negative numbers and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 9: Addition with Maximum and Minimum Integer Values
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_max_min_integer_values
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition involving the maximum and minimum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(sys.maxsize, sys.minsize)
  Assert: The result should be 1 because sys.maxsize + sys.minsize + 2 = 1
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case of maximum and minimum integer values and includes the extra 2.

Scenario 10: Addition with Identical Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_identical_numbers
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles addition with two identical numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call addition(7, 7)
  Assert: The result should be 20 because 7 + 7 + 2 = 20
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly handles the case where both numbers are the same and includes the extra 2.
