Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `division` function using the pytest framework, focusing on its business logic and behavior:

```
Scenario 1: Division by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the function returns the message "Cannot divide by zero" when the second number is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 10 and num2 = 0.
  Assert: The result should be "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  Rationalize: Ensuring the function handles division by zero gracefully is crucial to avoid runtime errors and to provide meaningful feedback to the user. This test verifies that the function adheres to this requirement.

Scenario 2: Positive division
Details:

  Rationalize: Positive numbers are standard use cases for division, and this test ensures the function works correctly under these conditions.

Scenario 3: Negative division
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_division
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns the quotient when both numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = -18 and num2 = -2.

Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 7 and num2 = 2.
  Assert: The result should be 3.5.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Properly handling decimal results is essential for the function's accuracy. This test ensures the function returns the correct decimal value.

Scenario 9: Division with large decimals
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_large_decimals
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles large decimal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 3.141592653589793 and num2 = 3.141592653589793.
  Assert: The result should be 1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Large decimal numbers are common in scientific computations, and this test ensures the function handles them accurately.

Scenario 10: Division with negative decimals
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_negative_decimals
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles negative decimal numbers.
Execution:
