  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 20 and num2 = 4.
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Positive numbers are standard use cases for division, and this test ensures the function works correctly under these conditions.

Scenario 3: Negative division
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_division
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns the quotient when both numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = -18 and num2 = -2.
  Assert: The result should be 9.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Negative numbers are also valid inputs, and this test ensures the function handles them as expected.

Scenario 4: Division with mixed signs
Details:
  TestName: test_mixed_signs_division
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns the quotient when the numbers have different signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 15 and num2 = -3.
  Assert: The result should be -5.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Mixed sign division is a common scenario, and this test ensures the function correctly handles it.

Scenario 5: Division by one
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_one
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns the original number when dividing by one.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 42 and num2 = 1.
  Assert: The result should be 42.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Dividing by one should return the original number, and this test verifies that the function adheres to this mathematical property.

Scenario 6: Large numbers division
Details:
  TestName: test_large_numbers_division
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 1000000 and num2 = 100.
  Assert: The result should be 10000.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Handling large numbers is important for the function's reliability, especially in performance-critical applications. This test ensures the function works correctly with large inputs.

Scenario 7: Small numbers division
Details:
  TestName: test_small_numbers_division
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles very small numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 0.000001 and num2 = 0.0000001.
  Assert: The result should be 10.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Handling small numbers is crucial for precision in scientific and engineering calculations. This test ensures the function works correctly with very small inputs.

Scenario 8: Division with decimal results
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_decimal_results
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns decimal results when the division is not an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 7 and num2 = 2.
  Assert: The result should be 3.5.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Properly handling decimal results is essential for the function's accuracy. This test ensures the function returns the correct decimal value.

Scenario 9: Division with large decimals
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_large_decimals
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles large decimal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = 3.141592653589793 and num2 = 3.141592653589793.
  Assert: The result should be 1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Large decimal numbers are common in scientific computations, and this test ensures the function handles them accurately.

Scenario 10: Division with negative decimals
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_negative_decimals
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles negative decimal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Invoke the division function with num1 = -3.141592653589793 and num2 = 3.141592653589793.
  Assert: The result should be -1.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Negative decimal numbers are a valid input, and this test ensures the function correctly handles them.
