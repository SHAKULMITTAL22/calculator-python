Certainly! Below are the test scenarios for the `absolute_difference` function using the pytest framework, following the specified format:

```
Scenario 1: Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference between two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with two positive numbers, e.g., `absolute_difference(5, 3)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `2`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it checks the basic functionality of the function with straightforward positive inputs.

Scenario 2: Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference between two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with two negative numbers, e.g., `absolute_difference(-5, -3)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `2`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function handles negative inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Mixed Sign Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_mixed_sign_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference when one number is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with one positive and one negative number, e.g., `absolute_difference(5, -3)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `8`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it checks the function's ability to handle mixed sign inputs.

Scenario 4: Equal Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_equal_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function returns 0 when the two numbers are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with two equal numbers, e.g., `absolute_difference(5, 5)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `0`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function correctly handles the edge case where the inputs are identical.

Scenario 5: Zero Difference
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_difference
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference when one number is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with one number being zero, e.g., `absolute_difference(0, 5)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `5`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it checks the function's behavior when one of the inputs is zero.

Scenario 6: Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference for large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with large numbers, e.g., `absolute_difference(1000000, 999999)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `1`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function can handle large inputs without precision issues.

Scenario 7: Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference for floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with floating-point numbers, e.g., `absolute_difference(1.5, 0.5)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `1.0`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it checks the function's ability to handle floating-point inputs.

Scenario 8: Same Number
Details:
  TestName: test_same_number
  Description: Verify that the function returns 0 when the same number is passed twice.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with the same number, e.g., `absolute_difference(7, 7)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `0`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function correctly handles the case where the inputs are the same.

Scenario 9: Different Signs with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_different_signs_with_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference when one number is zero and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with one number being zero and the other being negative, e.g., `absolute_difference(0, -3)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `3`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it checks the function's behavior with zero and negative inputs.

Scenario 10: Large Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference for very large negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with very large negative numbers, e.g., `absolute_difference(-1000000, -999999)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `1`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function can handle large negative inputs without precision issues.
