Scenario 1: Basic Positive and Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_pos_neg
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference between a positive and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(5, -3).
  Assert: The result should be 8, as abs(5 - (-3)) = 8.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles the basic case of positive and negative numbers as inputs correctly. This scenario is crucial as it validates the core functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Both Numbers Positive
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_both_pos
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference when both inputs are positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(10, 4).
  Assert: The result should be 6, as abs(10 - 4) = 6.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle cases where both numbers are positive. It is essential to confirm the function works as expected in straightforward positive number scenarios.

Scenario 3: Both Numbers Negative
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_both_neg
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference when both inputs are negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(-10, -7).
  Assert: The result should be 3, as abs(-10 - (-7)) = 3.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle negative numbers and computes the correct absolute difference. It is important to verify that the function's logic remains consistent across different numeric ranges.

Scenario 4: Same Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_same_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function returns 0 when the two input numbers are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(8, 8).
  Assert: The result should be 0, as abs(8 - 8) = 0.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior when the inputs are identical. It is crucial to ensure the function handles such cases correctly, as it validates the boundary condition where the difference is zero.

Scenario 5: Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference for large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(1000000, 1).
  Assert: The result should be 999999, as abs(1000000 - 1) = 999999.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large numerical values without precision issues. It validates the function's robustness in scenarios involving extremely large numbers.

Scenario 6: Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_floating_point
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference for floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(3.5, 1.2).
  Assert: The result should be 2.3, as abs(3.5 - 1.2) = 2.3.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle floating-point numbers. It is important to ensure the function's precision and correctness when dealing with non-integer values.

Scenario 7: One Number Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_one_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(0, 5).
  Assert: The result should be 5, as abs(0 - 5) = 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles the case where one of the inputs is zero. It validates the function's behavior in scenarios involving zero as an input value.

Scenario 8: Negative and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_negative_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference when one number is negative and the other is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(-5, 0).
  Assert: The result should be 5, as abs(-5 - 0) = 5.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's behavior when one input is negative and the other is zero. It is crucial to confirm the function's logic in mixed sign scenarios involving zero.

Scenario 9: Large Negative and Small Positive
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_large_neg_small_pos
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference when one number is a large negative number and the other is a small positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(-1000, 50).
  Assert: The result should be 1050, as abs(-1000 - 50) = 1050.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles large negative and small positive numbers correctly. It validates the function's logic in scenarios involving significant numeric differences.

Scenario 10: Large Positive and Small Negative
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_large_pos_small_neg
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the absolute difference when one number is a large positive number and the other is a small negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(1000, -50).
  Assert: The result should be 1050, as abs(1000 - (-50)) = 1050.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's behavior when one input is a large positive number and the other is a small negative number. It is important to confirm the function's logic in scenarios involving significant numeric differences.
