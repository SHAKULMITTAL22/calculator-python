Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `absolute_difference` function using the pytest framework:

```
Scenario 1: Both numbers are positive and num1 is greater than num2
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_numbers_num1_greater
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference when both numbers are positive and the first number is greater.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(10, 5).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles the scenario where both numbers are positive and the first number is larger.

Scenario 2: Both numbers are positive and num2 is greater than num1
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_numbers_num2_greater
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference when both numbers are positive and the second number is greater.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(5, 10).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  Validates the function's behavior when both numbers are positive and the second number is larger.

Scenario 3: Both numbers are negative and num1 is greater than num2
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_numbers_num1_greater
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference when both numbers are negative and the first number is greater.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(-5, -10).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles negative numbers where the first number is larger.

Scenario 4: Both numbers are negative and num2 is greater than num1
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_numbers_num2_greater
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference when both numbers are negative and the second number is greater.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(-10, -5).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  Validates the function's behavior with negative numbers where the second number is larger.

Scenario 5: One number is positive and the other is negative
Details:
  TestName: test_one_positive_one_negative
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference when one number is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(10, -5).
  Assert: The result should be 15.
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles the scenario where one number is positive and the other is negative.

Scenario 6: Both numbers are zero
Details:
  TestName: test_both_numbers_zero
  Description: Verifies that the function returns zero when both numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(0, 0).
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  Validates the function's behavior when both input numbers are zero.

Scenario 7: Large positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_positive_numbers
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference for large positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(1000000, 1).
  Assert: The result should be 999999.
Validation:
  Ensures the function handles large positive numbers correctly.

Scenario 8: Large negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_negative_numbers
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference for large negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(-1000000, -1).
  Assert: The result should be 999999.
Validation:
  Validates the function's behavior with large negative numbers.

Scenario 9: One number is zero and the other is positive
Details:
  TestName: test_one_zero_one_positive
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference when one number is zero and the other is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(0, 10).
  Assert: The result should be 10.
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles the case where one number is zero and the other is positive.

Scenario 10: One number is zero and the other is negative
Details:
  TestName: test_one_zero_one_negative
  Description: Verifies that the function returns the correct absolute difference when one number is zero and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference(0, -10).
  Assert: The result should be 10.
Validation:
  Validates the function's behavior when one number is zero and the other is negative.
