Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `absolute_difference` function using the pytest framework:

```
Scenario 1: Positive and Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_and_positive_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference between two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with two positive integers.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the addition and absolute value correctly for positive inputs, which is a fundamental aspect of the function's logic.

Scenario 2: Positive and Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_and_negative_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when one of the inputs is negative and the other is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with a positive and a negative integer.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the subtraction of a negative number from a positive number and then takes the absolute value.

Scenario 3: Negative and Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_and_negative_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference between two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with two negative integers.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly manages the addition of two negative numbers and then takes the absolute value.

Scenario 4: Zero and Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_and_positive_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when one of the inputs is zero and the other is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with zero and a positive integer.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the positive number (since 0 does not affect the sum).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where one of the inputs is zero and the other is positive.

Scenario 5: Zero and Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_and_negative_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when one of the inputs is zero and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with zero and a negative integer.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the negative number (since 0 does not affect the sum).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where one of the inputs is zero and the other is negative.

Scenario 6: Equal Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_equal_positive_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference when the inputs are equal positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with two equal positive integers.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of twice the number (since the sum is doubled).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the inputs are equal positive numbers.

Scenario 7: Equal Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_equal_negative_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference when the inputs are equal negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with two equal negative integers.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of twice the number (since the sum is doubled).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the inputs are equal negative numbers.

Scenario 8: Large Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_positive_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with large positive numbers to ensure it handles large values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with two large positive integers.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the sum of the two large numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly manages very large positive numbers, which could potentially cause overflow issues in some languages but not in Python.

Scenario 9: Large Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_negative_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with large negative numbers to ensure it handles large values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with two large negative integers.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the sum of the two large negative numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly manages very large negative numbers, which could potentially cause overflow issues in some languages but not in Python.

Scenario 10: Float Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_float_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the absolute difference between two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke absolute_difference with two floating-point numbers.
  Assert: The result should be the absolute value of the sum of the two floating-point numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles floating-point arithmetic correctly, which is a critical aspect for numerical stability.
```

These scenarios cover a range of possible inputs and edge cases to thoroughly validate the `absolute_difference` function.
