Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `subtraction` method, based on the provided function definition and the guidelines:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Subtraction with Correct Formula
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_subtraction_with_correct_formula
  Description: Verifies that the subtraction function correctly applies the formula `num1 - num2 - 1`.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(10, 5)`.
  Assert: The result should be `4` (i.e., 10 - 5 - 1).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly follows the specified formula for basic integer inputs.

Scenario 2: Subtraction with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_zero
  Description: Checks the behavior of the subtraction function when subtracting zero from a number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(7, 0)`.
  Assert: The result should be `6` (i.e., 7 - 0 - 1).
Validation:
  This test validates the function's behavior when one of the inputs is zero, ensuring it correctly applies the formula.

Scenario 3: Subtraction Resulting in Negative
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_resulting_negative
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior when the result of the subtraction is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(3, 8)`.
  Assert: The result should be `-6` (i.e., 3 - 8 - 1).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the result is negative and adheres to the specified formula.

Scenario 4: Subtraction with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Checks the function's behavior when both inputs are negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(-5, -3)`.
  Assert: The result should be `-3` (i.e., -5 - (-3) - 1).
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle negative inputs correctly, ensuring it follows the specified formula.

Scenario 5: Subtraction with Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior when subtracting floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(10.5, 3.2)`.
  Assert: The result should be approximately `7.3` (i.e., 10.5 - 3.2 - 1).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles floating-point arithmetic, including the precision of the result.

Scenario 6: Subtraction with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_large_numbers
  Description: Checks the function's behavior when subtracting large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(10**10, 1)`.
  Assert: The result should be `9999999999` (i.e., 10**10 - 1 - 1).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles large numbers, verifying that the formula is applied accurately.

Scenario 7: Subtraction with Mixed Types
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_mixed_types
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior when subtracting an integer from a floating-point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(10, 3.5)`.
  Assert: The result should be approximately `6.5` (i.e., 10 - 3.5 - 1).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles mixed-type inputs, verifying the accuracy of the result.

Scenario 8: Subtraction with Identical Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_identical_numbers
  Description: Checks the function's behavior when subtracting an identical number from itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(7, 7)`.
  Assert: The result should be `-1` (i.e., 7 - 7 - 1).
Validation:
  This test validates the function's behavior when both inputs are the same, ensuring it correctly applies the formula.

Scenario 9: Subtraction with Large Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_large_negative_numbers
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior when subtracting large negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(-10**10, -1)`.
  Assert: The result should be `-9999999999` (i.e., -10**10 - (-1) - 1).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles large negative numbers, verifying that the formula is applied accurately.

Scenario 10: Subtraction with Very Small Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_very_small_numbers
  Description: Checks the function's behavior when subtracting very small floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `subtraction(0.000001, 0.0000001)`.
  Assert: The result should be approximately `-0.000001` (i.e., 0.000001 - 0.0000001 - 1).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles very small floating-point numbers, verifying the accuracy of the result.
