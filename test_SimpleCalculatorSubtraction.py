Here are several test scenarios for the `subtraction` function using the pytest framework:

### Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_two_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the difference between two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 5)
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic arithmetic operation of subtraction is performed correctly for positive integers, which is a common use case in numerical computations.

### Scenario 2: Subtracting two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_two_negative_integers
  Description: This test checks if the function properly handles subtraction where both operands are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(-10, -5)
  Assert: The result should be -5.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the subtraction logic is correctly applied to negative numbers, ensuring accurate financial and scientific calculations involving negative values.

### Scenario 3: Subtracting a positive integer from a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_from_negative_integer
  Description: This test ensures that the subtraction result is correct when a positive number is subtracted from a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(-10, 5)
  Assert: The result should be -15.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's capability to handle cases where the minuend is less than the subtrahend, a scenario common in debt or loss calculations.

### Scenario 4: Subtracting a negative integer from a positive integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_negative_from_positive_integer
  Description: This test verifies correct calculation when a negative number is subtracted from a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, -5)
  Assert: The result should be 15.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the addition-like behavior of subtracting a negative, ensuring the function supports fundamental arithmetic rules correctly.

### Scenario 5: Subtracting zero from an integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_zero_from_integer
  Description: This test checks the function's output when zero is subtracted from an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 0)
  Assert: The result should be 10.
Validation:
  Testing subtraction of zero is essential to confirm that the identity element of addition (zero) behaves correctly in subtraction, which is critical for accurate calculations in loops or iterative processes.

### Scenario 6: Subtracting an integer from itself
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_integer_from_itself
  Description: This test ensures that subtracting an integer from itself always results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 10)
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  This test confirms the property of identity in subtraction, important in algorithms that rely on zeroing out values.
