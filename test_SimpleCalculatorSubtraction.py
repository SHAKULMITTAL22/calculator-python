```
Scenario 1: Basic Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_subtraction
  Description: Verify that the function correctly performs the subtraction of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(5, 3).
  Assert: The result should be 2.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test verifies the core functionality of the subtraction function with simple positive integers, ensuring it adheres to basic arithmetic operations.

Scenario 2: Subtraction with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Validate the function's ability to handle negative numbers in the subtraction.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(-5, -3).
  Assert: The result should be -2.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative inputs, a common edge case in arithmetic operations.

Scenario 3: Subtraction with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_zero
  Description: Check the behavior of the function when one of the input numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(5, 0) and subtraction(0, 5).
  Assert: The results should be 5 and -5 respectively.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test validates that subtracting zero from a number returns the original number, confirming the function's behavior with neutral elements.

Scenario 4: Subtraction of Equal Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_equal_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function correctly handles the case where both input numbers are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(5, 5).
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test checks the function's behavior when subtracting a number from itself, validating the function's handling of identical inputs.

Scenario 5: Large Number Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_large_number_subtraction
  Description: Verify the function's ability to handle large numbers without precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(1000000, 500000).
  Assert: The result should be 500000.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function can manage large inputs accurately, which is crucial for applications requiring precision in arithmetic operations.

Scenario 6: Floating Point Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_floating_point_subtraction
  Description: Check the function's behavior with floating-point numbers to ensure precision.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(3.5, 1.2).
  Assert: The result should be 2.3.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test validates the function's handling of floating-point numbers, ensuring it maintains precision in arithmetic operations.

Scenario 7: Mixed Integer and Floating Point Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_mixed_integer_floating_point_subtraction
  Description: Ensure the function correctly handles subtraction involving both integer and floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 3.5).
  Assert: The result should be 6.5.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test confirms the function's ability to perform mixed arithmetic, which is essential for diverse input scenarios.

Scenario 8: Subtraction with Large Range of Values
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_large_range_of_values
  Description: Validate the function's behavior with a wide range of values to ensure robustness.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(1e10, 1e9).
  Assert: The result should be 9e9.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures the function can handle a broad range of values, validating its performance and accuracy in diverse conditions.
