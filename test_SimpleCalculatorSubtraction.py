Certainly! Here are the test scenarios for the `subtraction` function using the pytest framework, following the specified format:

```
Scenario 1: Standard Subtraction with Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly computes the difference for two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(5, 3).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 1 (5 - 3 - 1 = 1).
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures the function handles standard arithmetic correctly and confirms the business logic of subtracting an additional 1.

Scenario 2: Subtraction with Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly computes the difference for two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(-5, -3).
  Assert: Ensure the result is -1 (-5 - (-3) - 1 = -1).
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures the function manages negative numbers correctly and adheres to the specified business logic.

Scenario 3: Subtraction with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_with_zero
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly handles subtraction involving zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(5, 0).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 4 (5 - 0 - 1 = 4).
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test confirms that the function correctly processes zero as one of the operands and adheres to the business logic.

Scenario 4: Subtraction with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly handles large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(1000000, 500000).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 499999 (1000000 - 500000 - 1 = 499999).
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures the function performs accurately with large input values, validating its numerical stability.

Scenario 5: Subtraction with Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly handles floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(5.5, 2.3).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 3.2 (5.5 - 2.3 - 1 = 3.2).
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test confirms the function processes floating-point arithmetic correctly and adheres to the specified business logic.

Scenario 6: Subtraction with Mixed Integer and Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_mixed_types
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly handles mixed integer and floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 3.5).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 6.5 (10 - 3.5 - 1 = 6.5).
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures the function manages mixed types correctly and adheres to the business logic.

Scenario 7: Subtraction Resulting in Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_result_zero
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly handles the scenario where the result is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call subtraction(3, 2).
  Assert: Ensure the result is -1 (3 - 2 - 1 = -1).
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures the function correctly processes scenarios where the result of the subtraction is zero, validating the business logic.
