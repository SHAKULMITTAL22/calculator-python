Here are several test scenarios for the `subtraction` function using the pytest framework:

### Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_two_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the difference between two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 5)
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic arithmetic operation of subtraction is performed correctly for positive integers, which is a common use case in various applications.

### Scenario 2: Subtracting two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_two_negative_integers
  Description: This test checks if the function properly handles subtraction where both operands are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(-10, -5)
  Assert: The result should be -5.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the subtraction logic is correctly applied to negative numbers, ensuring accurate financial and scientific calculations involving negative values.

### Scenario 3: Subtracting a positive integer from a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_from_negative_integer
  Description: This test ensures that the subtraction result is correct when a positive integer is subtracted from a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(-10, 5)
  Assert: The result should be -15.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's capability to handle cases where numbers of differing signs are subtracted, which is crucial for correct debt, credit, and other similar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Subtracting a negative integer from a positive integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_negative_from_positive_integer
  Description: Verify the function's ability to subtract a negative integer from a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, -5)
  Assert: The result should be 15.
Validation:
  This test checks the arithmetic correctness when a negative number is subtracted from a positive one, effectively testing the addition of two positive numbers, which is commonly required in adjustments and corrections in data processing.

### Scenario 5: Subtracting zero from a number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_zero_from_a_number
  Description: This test verifies that subtracting zero does not change the number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 0)
  Assert: The result should be 10.
Validation:
  This test confirms the mathematical property that any number minus zero equals the number itself, which is fundamental for ensuring no unintended changes occur during data manipulations involving zero values.

### Scenario 6: Subtracting a number from itself
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_a_number_from_itself
  Description: Ensures that subtracting a number from itself returns zero, as per the identity property of subtraction.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call subtraction(5, 5)
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the identity property of subtraction, which is crucial in many algorithms where resetting or nullifying values is required.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the subtraction function behaves as expected across a variety of common and edge cases, making it reliable for use in broader applications.
