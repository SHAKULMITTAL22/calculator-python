Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `addition` function using the `pytest` framework, focusing on business logic and behavior rather than data types:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_addition
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns the sum of two positive numbers plus 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with two positive integers, e.g., addition(3, 4).
  Assert: The result should be 9 (3 + 4 + 2).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function performs simple addition correctly and adheres to its specified behavior of adding 2 to the sum of the inputs.

Scenario 2: Addition with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function handles negative numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with one positive and one negative integer, e.g., addition(-3, 4).
  Assert: The result should be 3 (-3 + 4 + 2).
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle negative inputs, ensuring the business logic of adding 2 to the sum is maintained.

Scenario 3: Addition with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  Description: Verify that adding zero to a number results in the number plus 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with zero and a positive number, e.g., addition(0, 5).
  Assert: The result should be 7 (0 + 5 + 2).
Validation:
  This test confirms that adding zero does not affect the sum, and the function still adds 2 as specified.

Scenario 4: Addition with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function handles large numbers without overflow or precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with large integers, e.g., addition(1000000, 2000000).
  Assert: The result should be 3000002 (1000000 + 2000000 + 2).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large input values correctly, maintaining the integrity of the addition operation.

Scenario 5: Addition with Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds floating-point numbers and ensures the result is accurate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with floating-point numbers, e.g., addition(3.5, 2.5).
  Assert: The result should be 8.0 (3.5 + 2.5 + 2).
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior with floating-point inputs, ensuring the result is as expected and the function does not introduce rounding errors.

Scenario 6: Addition with Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_mixed_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles mixed positive and negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with mixed positive and negative integers, e.g., addition(-5, 10).
  Assert: The result should be 7 (-5 + 10 + 2).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can correctly manage combinations of positive and negative inputs, verifying the consistency of the business logic.

Scenario 7: Addition with Boundary Values
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_boundary_values
  Description: Verify that the function behaves correctly with boundary values such as the minimum and maximum representable integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the addition function with boundary values, e.g., addition(-2**31, 2**31 - 1).
  Assert: The result should be 1 (-2**31 + (2**31 - 1) + 2).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles edge cases correctly, verifying that it does not fail with extreme values.
```

These scenarios cover a range of inputs and edge cases to validate the business logic and behavior of the `addition` function.
