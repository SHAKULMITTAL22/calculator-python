Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `addition` function using the pytest framework:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Addition
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_addition
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns the sum of two numbers plus one.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with two integers, num1 = 2 and num2 = 3.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 6.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it verifies the fundamental behavior of the addition function with simple integers.

Scenario 2: Addition with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  Description: Verify that adding zero to a number results in the number plus one.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with num1 = 5 and num2 = 0.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 6.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to ensure the function handles the addition of zero correctly.

Scenario 3: Addition with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the addition of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with num1 = -2 and num2 = -3.
  Assert: Expect the result to be -4.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to validate that the function works as expected with negative inputs.

Scenario 4: Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function can handle large numbers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with num1 = 1000000 and num2 = 2000000.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 3000001.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to ensure the function can manage large numerical inputs correctly.

Scenario 5: Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the addition of floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with num1 = 1.5 and num2 = 2.5.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 4.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to validate the function's behavior with floating-point inputs.

Scenario 6: Mixed Integer and Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_mixed_integer_and_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the addition of an integer and a floating-point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with num1 = 5 and num2 = 1.5.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 7.5.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to ensure the function can add mixed data types correctly.

Scenario 7: Large and Small Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_and_small_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the addition of a large number and a small number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with num1 = 1000000 and num2 = 0.000001.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 1000001.000001.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to ensure the function can handle the precision of large and small numbers.

Scenario 8: Negative and Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_and_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the addition of a negative number and a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call the addition function with num1 = -5 and num2 = 10.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 6.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to ensure the function can handle the addition of numbers with different signs.
```

These scenarios cover a variety of input cases to ensure that the `addition` function behaves as expected under different conditions.
