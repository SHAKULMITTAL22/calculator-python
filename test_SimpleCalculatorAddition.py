### Test Scenarios for `addition` Function

---

#### Scenario 1: Adding two positive integers
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_positive_integers  
  **Description**: Verify that the function correctly adds two positive integer values and returns the expected sum.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare two positive integer values, e.g., `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 10`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `15`, which is the correct sum of `5 + 10`.  

Validation:  
  Adding two positive integers is a fundamental test to ensure the correctness of the primary behavior of the function under normal circumstances.

---

#### Scenario 2: Adding a positive integer to a negative integer
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_positive_and_negative_integers  
  **Description**: Verify that the function handles addition involving a positive integer and a negative integer correctly.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare a positive integer, e.g., `num1 = 15`, and a negative integer, e.g., `num2 = -5`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `10`, which is the expected result of `15 + (-5)`.  

Validation:  
  Testing the interaction of positive and negative numbers ensures the function correctly handles a mix of integer signs.

---

#### Scenario 3: Adding two negative integers
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_negative_integers  
  **Description**: Verify that the function properly adds two negative integers and returns the correct sum.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., `num1 = -10` and `num2 = -20`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `-30`, which is the correct sum of `-10 + (-20)`.  

Validation:  
  This test ensures that the addition logic holds true even for negative integers, covering another important mathematical scenario.

---

#### Scenario 4: Adding zero to an integer
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_with_zero  
  **Description**: Validate that adding zero to any integer returns the same integer as expected in arithmetic.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare an integer, e.g., `num1 = 42`, and zero, i.e., `num2 = 0`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `42`, confirming that adding zero does not change the integer.  

Validation:  
  This test ensures the function adheres to the mathematical property of addition involving zero.

---

#### Scenario 5: Adding two floating-point numbers
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_floats  
  **Description**: Validate that the function can accurately add two floating-point numbers.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare two floating-point numbers, e.g., `num1 = 1.5` and `num2 = 2.5`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `4.0`, the precise sum of `1.5 + 2.5`.  

Validation:  
  This test ensures that the function supports fractional values and handles floating-point arithmetic correctly.

---

#### Scenario 6: Adding an integer and a floating-point number
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_integer_and_float  
  **Description**: Verify that the function can correctly add an integer and a floating-point number.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare an integer, e.g., `num1 = 10`, and a floating-point number, e.g., `num2 = 5.5`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `15.5`, which is the exact sum of `10 + 5.5`.  

Validation:  
  Including mixed numeric types in testing helps ensure that the function supports Python's implicit type conversion rules.

---

#### Scenario 7: Adding two very large numbers
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_large_numbers  
  **Description**: Validate that the function can handle and return the correct sum of two very large numbers without overflow.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare two large numbers, e.g., `num1 = 10**15` and `num2 = 10**15`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `2 * 10**15`, which is the precise sum of the input values.  

Validation:  
  This test ensures the function can handle large numeric ranges and does not introduce errors due to size limitations.

---

#### Scenario 8: Adding two very small numbers
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_small_numbers  
  **Description**: Verify that the function can handle very small floating-point numbers without loss of precision.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare two small numbers, e.g., `num1 = 1e-10` and `num2 = 2e-10`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `3e-10`, which matches the precise sum.  

Validation:  
  This test ensures that the function maintains accuracy with floating-point numbers at the lower end of the numerical range.

---

#### Scenario 9: Adding identical numbers
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_identical_numbers  
  **Description**: Validate that the function correctly handles and returns the doubled value when identical numbers are added.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare two identical integers, e.g., `num1 = 7` and `num2 = 7`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `14`, which is the doubled value of `7`.  

Validation:  
  This test verifies that the function accurately processes redundant inputs and returns the appropriate sum.

---

#### Scenario 10: Adding a large floating-point number and a small integer
Details:  
  **TestName**: test_addition_large_float_and_small_integer  
  **Description**: Verify that the function computes the precise sum of a large floating-point number and a small integer.  

Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Prepare a large floating-point number such as `num1 = 1e10` and a small integer like `num2 = 1`.  
  **Act**: Call the `addition` function with these values.  
  **Assert**: Ensure the returned value is `1e10 + 1`.  

Validation:  
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly handles sums where significant differences exist in the magnitude of the operands.  

---  

By covering these scenarios, the tests thoroughly validate the correctness, behavior, and reliability of the `addition` function.
