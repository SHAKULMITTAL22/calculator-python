Based on the provided function definition and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios for the `addition` method using the pytest framework:

```
Scenario 1: Verify Addition Result with Identical Non-Zero Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_identical_non_zero_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the addition method correctly handles the scenario where both numbers are identical and non-zero, ensuring the business logic of adding two numbers and then adding an extra 1 is correctly implemented.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with two identical non-zero numbers, e.g., num1 = 5, num2 = 5.
  Assert: Check that the result is 11.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves correctly when adding two identical non-zero numbers, validating the basic arithmetic operation and the additional increment logic.

Scenario 2: Verify Addition Result with One Zero and One Non-Zero Number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_one_zero_one_non_zero
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when one of the numbers is zero and the other is non-zero, ensuring the sum is correct.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with one zero and one non-zero number, e.g., num1 = 0, num2 = 5.
  Assert: Check that the result is 6.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle scenarios involving zero, ensuring the function does not incorrectly treat zero as a special case.

Scenario 3: Verify Addition Result with Large and Small Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_and_small_numbers
  Description: This test ensures the function can handle the addition of a large number and a small number, verifying that the result is correct despite the large difference in magnitudes.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with a large number and a small number, e.g., num1 = 1000000, num2 = 0.0001.
  Assert: Check that the result is 1000001.0001.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's precision and ability to handle large and small numbers, ensuring the additional increment logic does not affect the result significantly.

Scenario 4: Verify Addition Result with Extremely Small Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_extremely_small_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with extremely small floating-point numbers, ensuring the precision of the result.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with extremely small floating-point numbers, e.g., num1 = 1e-15, num2 = 2e-15.
  Assert: Check that the result is 3.000000000000003e-15.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles extremely small floating-point numbers correctly, validating the precision of the addition operation and the additional increment logic.

Scenario 5: Verify Addition Result with Large and Extremely Small Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_and_extremely_small_numbers
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when adding a large number and an extremely small number, ensuring the result is not significantly affected by the large number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with a large number and an extremely small number, e.g., num1 = 1000000, num2 = 1e-10.
  Assert: Check that the result is approximately 1000001.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle large and extremely small numbers, ensuring the additional increment logic does not affect the result significantly.

Scenario 6: Verify Addition Result with Extremely Large and Small Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_extremely_large_and_small_negative_numbers
  Description: This test ensures the function can handle the addition of extremely large negative numbers and small negative numbers, verifying the correctness of the result.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with extremely large negative numbers and small negative numbers, e.g., num1 = -1e15, num2 = -1e-10.
  Assert: Check that the result is approximately -1e15.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle extremely large and small negative numbers, ensuring the additional increment logic does not affect the result significantly.

Scenario 7: Verify Addition Result with Maximum and Minimum Integer Values
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_max_and_min_integer_values
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when adding the maximum and minimum integer values, ensuring the result is correct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Import the sys module to access maxsize and minsize.
  Act: Invoke the addition function with sys.maxsize and sys.minsize.
  Assert: Check that the result is -1.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle edge cases involving the maximum and minimum integer values, ensuring the additional increment logic does not affect the result significantly.
