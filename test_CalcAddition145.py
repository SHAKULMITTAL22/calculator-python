Below are the test scenarios for the `addition` function:

### Scenario 1: Addition of a Large Positive Integer and a Small Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_and_small_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large positive integer and a small positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a large positive integer and `num2` with a small positive integer.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that the function can handle and correctly add numbers of significantly different magnitudes.

### Scenario 2: Addition of a Large Negative Integer and a Small Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_and_small_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large negative integer and a small negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a large negative integer and `num2` with a small negative integer.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that the function can handle and correctly add numbers of significantly different magnitudes in negative values.

### Scenario 3: Addition of a Positive Integer and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_integer_and_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a positive integer and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a positive integer and `num2` with zero.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the positive integer.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to confirm that adding zero to a number returns the original number.

### Scenario 4: Addition of a Negative Integer and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_negative_integer_and_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a negative integer and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a negative integer and `num2` with zero.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the negative integer.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to confirm that adding zero to a number returns the original number.

### Scenario 5: Addition of a Positive Fraction and a Small Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_fraction_and_small_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a positive fraction and a small positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a positive fraction and `num2` with a small positive integer.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that the function can handle and correctly add fractions and integers.

### Scenario 6: Addition of a Negative Fraction and a Small Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_negative_fraction_and_small_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a negative fraction and a small negative integer.

  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a negative fraction and `num2` with a small negative integer.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that the function can handle and correctly add fractions and integers, even in negative values.

### Scenario 7: Addition of Positive and Negative Fractions
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_and_negative_fractions
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a positive fraction and a negative fraction.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a positive fraction and `num2` with a negative fraction.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that the function can handle and correctly add fractions of different signs.

### Scenario 8: Addition of Large Positive Fraction and Large Negative Fraction
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_and_negative_fractions
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large positive fraction and a large negative fraction.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a large positive fraction and `num2` with a large negative fraction.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that the function can handle and correctly add large fractions of different signs.

### Scenario 9: Addition of a Large Integer and a Fraction
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_integer_and_fraction
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large integer and a fraction.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a large integer and `num2` with a fraction.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that the function can handle and correctly add integers and fractions of significantly different magnitudes.

### Scenario 10: Addition of a Fraction and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_fraction_and_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a fraction and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` with a fraction and `num2` with zero.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the result is the fraction.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to confirm that adding zero to a fraction returns the original fraction.
