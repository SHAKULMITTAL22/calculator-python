Here are the test scenarios for the `addition` function, considering the provided constraints:

### Scenario 1: Addition of Two Large Positive Floats
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two large positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum of the two floating-point numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements.

### Scenario 2: Addition of Two Small Positive Floats
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_small_positive_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two small positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two small positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum of the two floating-point numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles floating-point precision correctly for small values.

### Scenario 3: Addition Resulting in Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_opposite_signs
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the addition of two numbers with opposite signs that sum to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one positive and one negative number of the same magnitude.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the addition of numbers that cancel each other out.

### Scenario 4: Addition of a Large Positive Integer and a Small Negative Fraction
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_integer_small_negative_fraction
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large positive integer and a small negative floating-point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large positive integer and a small negative floating-point number.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle mixed types and magnitudes correctly.

### Scenario 5: Addition of Two Large Negative Floats
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_negative_floats

  Arrange: Initialize a positive floating-point number and zero.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the positive floating-point number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that adding zero to a number returns the original number, maintaining the identity property of addition.

### Scenario 7: Addition of a Negative Float and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_negative_float_and_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a negative floating-point number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a negative floating-point number and zero.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the negative floating-point number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that adding zero to a number returns the original number, maintaining the identity property of addition.

### Scenario 8: Addition of Two Small Negative Floats
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_small_negative_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two small negative floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two small negative floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum of the two floating-point numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles floating-point precision correctly for small negative values.

### Scenario 9: Addition of a Large Positive Integer and a Large Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_and_large_negative_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large positive integer and a large negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large positive integer and a large negative integer.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large integers of opposite signs correctly.

### Scenario 10: Addition of Two Large Opposite Floats
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_opposite_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two large floating-point numbers of opposite signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large floating-point numbers of opposite signs.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large floating-point numbers of opposite signs correctly and checks for potential precision issues.

These scenarios aim to cover a wide range of cases, ensuring the `addition` function performs correctly across different types of numerical inputs and edge cases.
