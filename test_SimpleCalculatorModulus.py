Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `modulus` function using the pytest framework:

```
Scenario 1: Modulus with fractional results
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_fractional_results
  Description: Verifies the function handles fractional results correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(5.5, 2.0)
  Assert: Expect result to be 1.5 (since 5.5 % 2.0 = 1.5)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles floating-point arithmetic and returns the expected fractional result.
```

```
Scenario 2: Modulus with negative results
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_negative_results
  Description: Verifies the function handles negative results correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(-10, 3)
  Assert: Expect result to be -1 (since -10 % 3 = -1)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles negative numbers and returns the expected result.
```

```
Scenario 3: Modulus with zero numerator and negative denominator
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_zero_numerator_negative_denominator
  Description: Verifies the function handles modulus with zero as the numerator and a negative denominator correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(0, -5)
  Assert: Expect result to be 0 (since 0 % -5 = 0)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles zero as the numerator and a negative denominator, returning zero.
```

```
Scenario 4: Modulus with negative numerator and positive denominator
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_negative_numerator_positive_denominator
  Description: Verifies the function handles modulus with a negative numerator and a positive denominator correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(-10, 3)
  Assert: Expect result to be -1 (since -10 % 3 = -1)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles a negative numerator and a positive denominator, returning the expected result.
```

```
Scenario 5: Modulus with negative numerator and negative denominator
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_negative_numerator_negative_denominator
  Description: Verifies the function handles modulus with both negative numerator and denominator correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(-10, -3)
  Assert: Expect result to be -1 (since -10 % -3 = -1)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles both negative numerator and denominator, returning the expected result.
```

```
Scenario 6: Modulus with very large positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_very_large_positive_numbers
  Description: Verifies the function handles very large positive numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(1234567890123456789, 9876543210987654321)
  Assert: Expect result to be 123456789 (since 1234567890123456789 % 9876543210987654321 = 123456789)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles very large positive numbers and returns the expected result.
```

```
Scenario 7: Modulus with very large negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_very_large_negative_numbers
  Description: Verifies the function handles very large negative numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(-1234567890123456789, -9876543210987654321)
  Assert: Expect result to be -123456789 (since -1234567890123456789 % -9876543210987654321 = -123456789)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles very large negative numbers and returns the expected result.
```

```
Scenario 8: Modulus with very large and very small numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_very_large_and_very_small_numbers
  Description: Verifies the function handles very large and very small numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(1234567890123456789, 0.0000000000000000001)
  Assert: Expect result to be 1234567890123456789 (since 1234567890123456789 % 0.0000000000000000001 is very large)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles very large and very small numbers and returns the expected result.
```

```
Scenario 9: Modulus with very small negative and very large positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_modulus_very_small_negative_and_very_large_positive_numbers
  Description: Verifies the function handles very small negative and very large positive numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call modulus(-0.0000000000000000001, 1234567890123456789)
  Assert: Expect result to be -0.0000000000000000001 (since -0.0000000000000000001 % 1234567890123456789 is very small negative)
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly handles very small negative and very large positive numbers and returns the expected result.
```

```
Scenario 10: Modulus with very small positive and very large negative numbers
