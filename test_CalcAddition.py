================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-758
Issue: Syntax error due to improper string literal usage and indentation issues. This can lead to code execution failure and potential undefined behaviors.
Solution: Ensure that proper string literals are used and correct the indentation to follow Python syntax rules.

Vulnerability: CWE-798
Issue: Hardcoded package name without specifying any version. This can lead to using potentially vulnerable versions of the package.
Solution: Specify the exact version of the package to use or use a requirements file to manage dependencies securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-89
Issue: Although the current function is not vulnerable, there is no input validation for `num1` and `num2`. If expanded, this could lead to injection attacks if inputs are not properly handled.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that `num1` and `num2` are of expected types (e.g., numbers).

Vulnerability: CWE-912
Issue: Improper use of triple quotes for block comments which can be confused with docstrings, leading to potential misinterpretation by developers or tools.
Solution: Use the '#' symbol for block comments instead of triple quotes to avoid confusion with docstrings.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Adding Two Positive Integers
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_positive_integers
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds two positive integers.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare two positive integer values, e.g., 5 and 10.
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 15.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function can handle basic positive integer addition, which is a common use case.

### Scenario 2: Adding Two Negative Integers
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_negative_integers
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds two negative integers.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare two negative integer values, e.g., -5 and -10.
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  - Assert: Check that the result is -15.

**Validation:**
  - This test checks the function's ability to handle negative integers, ensuring it can process a broader range of inputs.

### Scenario 3: Adding a Positive and a Negative Integer
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_mixed_sign_integers
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare a positive integer value (e.g., 10) and a negative integer value (e.g., -5).
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 5.

**Validation:**
  - This test confirms that the function can correctly handle and sum integers of differing signs.

### Scenario 4: Adding Zero to an Integer
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  - Description: Verifies that adding zero to an integer returns the integer itself.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare an integer value (e.g., 10) and zero.
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 10.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures that the function adheres to the mathematical property that any number plus zero is the number itself.

### Scenario 5: Adding Two Zeros
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_two_zeros
  - Description: Verifies that adding two zeros returns zero.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare two zero values.
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 0.

**Validation:**
  - This test confirms the function correctly handles the edge case of adding two zeros.

### Scenario 6: Adding Large Integers
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_large_integers
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds large integers without overflow.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare two large integer values (e.g., 10^10 and 10^10).
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 2 * 10^10.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures the function can handle large numbers, which is important for applications dealing with big data or high-value transactions.

### Scenario 7: Adding Floating Point Numbers
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_floats
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds floating-point numbers.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare two floating-point values (e.g., 1.5 and 2.5).
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 4.0.

**Validation:**
  - This test examines the function's ability to handle and correctly sum floating-point numbers, which is crucial for applications requiring precision.

### Scenario 8: Adding a Floating Point Number and an Integer
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_float_and_integer
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds a floating-point number and an integer.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare a floating-point value (e.g., 1.5) and an integer value (e.g., 2).
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 3.5.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures the function can handle mixed numeric types, which is common in real-world applications.

### Scenario 9: Adding Negative Floating Point Numbers
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_negative_floats
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds negative floating-point numbers.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare two negative floating-point values (e.g., -1.5 and -2.5).
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is -4.0.

**Validation:**
  - This test checks the function's ability to handle and correctly sum negative floating-point numbers, ensuring robustness.

### Scenario 10: Adding Very Small Floating Point Numbers
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_addition_small_floats
  - Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds very small floating-point numbers.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare two small floating-point values (e.g., 1e-10 and 2e-10).
  - Act: Call the `addition` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 3e-10.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures the function can handle and correctly sum very small floating-point numbers, which is important for scientific and engineering applications.
