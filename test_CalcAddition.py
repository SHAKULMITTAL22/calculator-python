================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-758
Issue: Syntax error due to improper string literal usage and indentation issues. This can lead to code execution failures and potential undefined behaviors.
Solution: Ensure that proper string literals are used and correct the indentation to follow Python syntax rules.

Vulnerability: CWE-798
Issue: Hardcoded credentials or sensitive information in the code comment. Though the actual code content is minimal, comments or dead code can sometimes reveal sensitive information.
Solution: Remove any hardcoded sensitive information from the code and comments. Use environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-20
Issue: The code lacks input validation for the `addition` function, which could lead to unexpected behaviors if non-numeric inputs are provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the inputs to the `addition` function are numeric.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Adding Two Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers, e.g., num1 = 5, num2 = 7.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 12.
Validation:
  This test is essential because correctly adding positive integers is a fundamental requirement for the addition function.

### Scenario 2: Adding Two Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers, e.g., num1 = -3, num2 = -8.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is -11.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles negative numbers correctly, which is crucial for comprehensive arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 3: Adding a Positive Integer and a Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_and_negative_integer
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and a negative integer, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = -4.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 6.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle mixed-sign inputs, which is important for real-world usage scenarios.

### Scenario 4: Adding Zero to a Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_zero_and_positive_integer
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly adds zero to a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a positive integer, e.g., num1 = 0, num2 = 9.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 9.
Validation:
  This test ensures that adding zero does not change the value of the other operand, which is a basic arithmetic property.

### Scenario 5: Adding Zero to a Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_zero_and_negative_integer
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly adds zero to a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero and a negative integer, e.g., num1 = 0, num2 = -5.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is -5.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function adheres to the arithmetic property where adding zero does not alter the other operand.

  TestName: test_addition_two_zeros
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two zeros, e.g., num1 = 0, num2 = 0.
  Act: Call the addition function with these zeros.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles the edge case of adding two zeros.

### Scenario 7: Adding Large Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums large positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large positive integers, e.g., num1 = 1000000, num2 = 2000000.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 3000000.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle and correctly sum large numerical values, which is critical for applications dealing with high-value data.

### Scenario 8: Adding Large Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums large negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large negative integers, e.g., num1 = -1000000, num2 = -2000000.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is -3000000.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function can manage and correctly sum large negative values, which is necessary for accurate financial and scientific computations.

### Scenario 9: Adding a Small Fractional Number to an Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_fraction_and_integer
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums a small fractional number and an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a small fractional number and an integer, e.g., num1 = 0.5, num2 = 4.
  Act: Call the addition function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 4.5.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle and accurately sum fractional and whole numbers, which is essential for precision in various applications.

### Scenario 10: Adding Two Fractional Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_fractions
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two fractional numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two fractional numbers, e.g., num1 = 0.25, num2 = 0.75.
  Act: Call the addition function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 1.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can accurately sum fractional values, which is necessary for applications requiring high precision.

### Scenario 11: Adding a Large Fractional Number to an Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_fraction_and_integer
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums a large fractional number and an integer.
Execution:
