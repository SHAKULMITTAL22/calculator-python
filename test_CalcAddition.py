### Test Scenarios for the `addition` Function

#### Scenario 1: Addition of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integer values.
  Act: Call the addition function with these two integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two integers.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the basic arithmetic operation of addition is performed correctly for positive integers, which is a common use case in numerical computations.

#### Scenario 2: Addition of two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integer values.
  Act: Call the addition function with these two integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two integers.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the addition function handles negative numbers correctly, which is crucial for applications dealing with a range of integer operations.

#### Scenario 3: Addition of a positive integer and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_positive_and_negative_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Act: Call the addition function with these two integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two integers.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle the addition of integers with different signs, ensuring accurate computation in scenarios involving debt, credits, or other financial calculations.

#### Scenario 4: Addition of zero with an integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_zero_and_integer
  Description: Verify that adding zero to an integer returns the integer itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer and zero.
  Act: Call the addition function with the integer and zero.
  Assert: Check that the result is the original integer.
Validation:
  This test confirms the identity property of addition (adding zero to a number yields that number), which is fundamental in ensuring the reliability of numerical operations in software.

#### Scenario 5: Addition of two very large integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_large_integers
  Description: Verify that the function can handle the addition of two very large integers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two very large integer values.
  Act: Call the addition function with these two integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two integers.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's capability to manage large numbers, which is essential for applications that perform high-precision calculations or operate on large datasets.

#### Scenario 6: Addition of two floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_two_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two floating-point values.
  Act: Call the addition function with these two floats.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two floats.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the addition function accurately processes floating-point numbers, which are commonly used in scientific calculations, financial applications, and other domains requiring fractional numbers.

#### Scenario 7: Addition of a floating-point number and an integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_float_and_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a floating-point number and an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a floating-point number and an integer.
  Act: Call the addition function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle mixed-type addition, which is typical in dynamically typed languages and necessary for versatile numerical software.
