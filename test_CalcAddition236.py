Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `addition` function, focusing on validating the business logic:

### Scenario 1: Adding Two Positive Fractions
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_positive_fractions
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds two positive fractions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 and num2 with 0.1 and 0.2, respectively.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.3.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function handles fractional addition correctly as part of its core functionality.

### Scenario 2: Adding a Large Positive Fraction and a Small Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_fraction_and_small_integer
  Description: Ensures the function can handle the addition of a large positive fraction and a small positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 with 1234567.89 and num2 with 1.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 1234568.89.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the function handling a mix of large and small values correctly.

### Scenario 3: Adding a Positive Fraction and a Negative Fraction
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_and_negative_fraction
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds a positive fraction and a negative fraction.

  Arrange: Initialize num1 with 0.5 and num2 with -0.2.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.3.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling fractional addition where one fraction is negative.

### Scenario 4: Adding Two Large Positive Fractions
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_large_positive_fractions
  Description: Ensures the function can handle the addition of two large positive fractions.

  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 1234567.89.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of confirming that the function handles the addition of zero correctly with large values.

### Scenario 7: Adding Two Large Negative Fractions
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_large_negative_fractions
  Description: Ensures the function can handle the addition of two large negative fractions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 with -1234567.89 and num2 with -9876543.21.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is -11111111.10.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring the function can handle large negative fractional values correctly.

### Scenario 8: Adding a Small Negative Fraction and a Large Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_small_negative_fraction_and_large_positive_integer
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds a small negative fraction and a large positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 with -0.1 and num2 with 1000000.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 999999.9.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling mixed-sign small and large values accurately.

### Scenario 9: Adding Two Small Positive Fractions
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_small_positive_fractions
  Description: Ensures the function correctly adds two small positive fractions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 with 0.01 and num2 with 0.02.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.03.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of confirming the function handles small fractional values accurately.

### Scenario 10: Adding a Positive Fraction and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_fraction_and_zero
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly adds a positive fraction and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 with 0.5 and num2 with 0.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.5.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of confirming that adding zero does not affect the value of the positive fraction.
