### Test Scenarios for the `subtraction` Function

#### Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_two_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 5).
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.
Validation:
  Rationalize that subtracting a smaller positive number from a larger positive number should yield a positive result, consistent with basic arithmetic rules.

#### Scenario 2: Subtracting two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_two_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call subtraction(-10, -5).
  Assert: Check that the result is -5.
Validation:
  Rationalize that subtracting a less negative number from a more negative number should yield a negative result, which aligns with standard arithmetic operations.

#### Scenario 3: Subtracting a positive number from a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_from_negative
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a positive number from a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call subtraction(-10, 5).
  Assert: Check that the result is -15.
Validation:
  Rationalize that subtracting a positive number from a negative number should increase the negative value, consistent with arithmetic principles.

#### Scenario 4: Subtracting a negative number from a positive number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_negative_from_positive
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a negative number from a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, -5).
  Assert: Check that the result is 15.
Validation:
  Rationalize that subtracting a negative number from a positive number should yield a larger positive result, following the rules of arithmetic.

#### Scenario 5: Subtracting zero from a number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_zero_from_number
  Description: Verify that subtracting zero does not change the number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 0).
  Assert: Check that the result is 10.
Validation:
  Rationalize that zero is the identity element for subtraction, and thus, subtracting zero from any number should return the original number.

#### Scenario 6: Subtracting a number from itself
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_number_from_itself
  Description: Verify that subtracting a number from itself results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call subtraction(10, 10).
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  Rationalize that subtracting any number from itself should always result in zero, as per the properties of subtraction.

#### Scenario 7: Subtracting large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function can handle large integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call subtraction(1000000000, 500000000).
  Assert: Check that the result is 500000000.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function should be able to handle large values without overflow or errors, ensuring robustness in various use cases.

These scenarios cover a range of basic arithmetic checks and edge cases to ensure that the `subtraction` function behaves as expected under different numerical conditions.
