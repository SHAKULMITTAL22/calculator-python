### Scenario 1: Subtracting Two Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = 5.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly performs basic subtraction for positive integers, which is a fundamental requirement.

### Scenario 2: Subtracting Two Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers, e.g., num1 = -10, num2 = -5.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles subtraction when both numbers are negative, which is important for comprehensive arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 3: Subtracting a Positive Number from a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_positive_from_negative
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a positive number from a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a negative number and a positive number, e.g., num1 = -5, num2 = 10.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle cases where a positive number is subtracted from a negative number, which is essential for accurate arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 4: Subtracting a Negative Number from a Positive Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_negative_from_positive
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a negative number from a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number and a negative number, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = -5.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 15.
Validation:

### Scenario 5: Subtracting Zero from a Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_zero_from_number
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts zero from any number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a number and zero, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = 0.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the original number, 10.
Validation:
  This test ensures that subtracting zero from any number returns the original number, which is a basic property of subtraction.

### Scenario 6: Subtracting a Number from Itself
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_number_from_itself
  Description: Verify that subtracting a number from itself returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a number, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = 10.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that subtracting any number from itself results in zero, which is a fundamental property of subtraction.

### Scenario 7: Subtracting Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the subtraction of large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large numbers, e.g., num1 = 1000000, num2 = 500000.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 500000.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large integers without any issues, which is important for applications dealing with substantial numerical values.

### Scenario 8: Subtracting Small Decimal Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_small_decimals
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the subtraction of small decimal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two small decimal numbers, e.g., num1 = 0.0005, num2 = 0.0002.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.0003.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can accurately handle decimal values, which is crucial for applications requiring precision.
