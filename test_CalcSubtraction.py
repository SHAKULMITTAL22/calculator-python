================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: SyntaxError
Issue: The code contains several syntax errors, including misplaced triple quotes and improper string literals. This will prevent the code from running and could lead to confusion or unintended behavior.
Solution: Correct the syntax errors by properly formatting the strings and ensuring the function definition is correctly indented and enclosed.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Although the provided code does not directly interact with databases, it's important to highlight that any user input in Python code should be sanitized to prevent SQL injection if used in database queries.
Solution: Ensure that user inputs are always sanitized and use parameterized queries when interacting with databases.

Vulnerability: CWE-94: Code Injection
Issue: The code does not currently have any dynamic execution of code. However, itâ€™s crucial to avoid using `eval`, `exec`, or similar functions that can execute arbitrary code, especially with user input.
Solution: Avoid using `eval` and `exec`. If dynamic execution is necessary, validate inputs rigorously to prevent code injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: There is no input validation in the `subtraction` function. While the function is simple, lack of input validation can lead to unexpected behavior if non-numeric inputs are provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the inputs are numeric before performing the subtraction.

Vulnerability: CWE-778: Insufficient Logging
Issue: This code does not include any logging. In the case of errors or unexpected behavior, lack of logging can make debugging difficult.
Solution: Add logging to capture significant events and errors. Use Python's `logging` module to implement this securely.
