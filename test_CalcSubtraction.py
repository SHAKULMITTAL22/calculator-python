### Test Scenarios for the `subtraction` Function

#### Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly computes the difference between two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose two positive integers, num1 and num2 where num1 > num2.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is equal to num1 - num2.
Validation:
  The test validates basic arithmetic subtraction, ensuring that the function can handle simple positive integer subtractions which are commonly expected in arithmetic operations.

#### Scenario 2: Subtracting two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly computes the difference between two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select two negative integers, num1 and num2, where num1 < num2.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is equal to num1 - num2.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle negative numbers, which is crucial for complete arithmetic support, especially under scenarios involving losses or negative balances.

#### Scenario 3: Subtracting a positive integer from a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_from_negative
  Description: Ensure the subtraction function correctly computes the difference when a positive integer is subtracted from a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a negative integer for num1 and a positive integer for num2.
  Act: Execute the subtraction function with these values.
  Assert: The result should match the expected negative outcome.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the subtraction operation across zero, which can be particularly problematic in boundary-related errors and is essential for financial and scientific calculations.

#### Scenario 4: Subtracting zero from an integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_zero
  Description: Confirm that subtracting zero from any integer returns the integer itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select any integer for num1 and set num2 to zero.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these parameters.
  Assert: The result should be the same as num1.
Validation:
  This test ensures the identity property of subtraction with zero, which is a fundamental property in arithmetic operations.

#### Scenario 5: Subtracting an integer from itself
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_same_numbers
  Description: Ensure that subtracting an integer from itself returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose any integer and use it for both num1 and num2.
  Act: Use the subtraction function on these identical numbers.
  Assert: The result should be zero.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's correct implementation of another basic arithmetic property, where any number minus itself should result in zero, relevant in various computational and financial contexts.

#### Scenario 6: Subtracting floating point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_floats
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly handles the subtraction of floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose two floating point numbers, num1 and num2, ensuring num1 is larger to avoid floating point precision issues in the assertion.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these floats.
  Assert: The result should closely match num1 - num2 within a small tolerance to account for floating point arithmetic errors.
Validation:
  Floating-point arithmetic is prone to precision issues. This test ensures that the function can handle such types without significant errors, crucial for applications requiring high precision.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `subtraction` function operates correctly across a range of typical and edge case inputs, affirming its reliability and correctness in various application contexts.
