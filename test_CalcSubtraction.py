### Scenario 1: Subtracting Two Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = 5.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly performs basic subtraction for positive integers, which is a fundamental requirement.

### Scenario 2: Subtracting Two Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers, e.g., num1 = -10, num2 = -5.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles subtraction when both numbers are negative, which is important for comprehensive arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 3: Subtracting a Positive Number from a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_positive_from_negative
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a positive number from a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a negative number and a positive number, e.g., num1 = -5, num2 = 10.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle cases where the minuend is negative and the subtrahend is positive.

### Scenario 4: Subtracting a Negative Number from a Positive Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_negative_from_positive
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a negative number from a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number and a negative number, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = -5.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the minuend is positive and the subtrahend is negative.

### Scenario 5: Subtracting Zero from Any Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_zero
  Description: Verify that subtracting zero from any number returns the original number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize any number, e.g., num1 = 7, and zero, num2 = 0.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 7.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the arithmetic property that subtracting zero from a number should return the original number.

### Scenario 6: Subtracting Any Number from Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_from_zero
  Description: Verify that subtracting any number from zero returns the negative of that number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize zero, num1 = 0, and any number, e.g., num2 = 7.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -7.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the minuend is zero, returning the negative of the subtrahend.

### Scenario 7: Subtracting Two Identical Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_identical_numbers
  Description: Verify that subtracting two identical numbers returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two identical numbers, e.g., num1 = 5, num2 = 5.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly implements the arithmetic rule that subtracting a number from itself should yield zero.

### Scenario 8: Subtracting Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large numbers, e.g., num1 = 10**10, num2 = 10**9.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 9 * 10**9.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large integers without overflow or precision issues, which is important for applications dealing with large datasets or financial calculations.

### Scenario 9: Subtracting Small Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_small_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts small floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two small floating-point numbers, e.g., num1 = 0.1, num2 = 0.2.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -0.1.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle floating-point arithmetic accurately, which is essential for scientific and engineering applications.

### Scenario 10: Subtracting Very Close Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_very_close_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two very close floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating-point numbers that are very close to each other, e.g., num1 = 1.0000001, num2 = 1.0000000.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.0000001.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle cases with minimal differences, which is crucial for applications requiring high precision.

By covering these scenarios, we ensure that the `subtraction` function behaves as expected across a wide range of inputs, fulfilling its intended purpose in various contexts.
