### Test Scenarios for the `subtraction` Function

#### Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly computes the difference between two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose two positive integers, num1 and num2 where num1 > num2.
  Act: Call the subtraction(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is num1 - num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic arithmetic operation of subtraction is implemented correctly for positive integers, which is a fundamental requirement for numerous mathematical computations.

#### Scenario 2: Subtracting two negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_negative_integers
  Description: Ensure that the subtraction function correctly computes the difference when both inputs are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select two negative integers, num1 and num2, where num1 < num2.
  Act: Invoke subtraction(num1, num2).
  Assert: Check that the result is num1 - num2.
Validation:
  Testing with negative numbers validates that the function handles sign correctly and adheres to mathematical rules concerning negative values.

#### Scenario 3: Subtracting a positive and a negative integer
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_positive_and_negative_integer
  Description: Test the subtraction of a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a positive integer for num1 and a negative integer for num2.
  Act: Execute subtraction(num1, num2).
  Assert: Confirm that the output is num1 - num2.
Validation:
  This scenario checks if the function correctly handles the subtraction involving different signs, ensuring the function's reliability across diverse numerical conditions.

#### Scenario 4: Subtracting zero from a number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_by_zero
  Description: Verify that subtracting zero from any number returns the number itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select any number for num1 and set num2 to zero.
  Act: Call subtraction(num1, num2).
  Assert: Ensure the result is num1.
Validation:
  This test is essential as subtracting zero is a common operation and should return the original number, confirming the identity property of zero in subtraction.

#### Scenario 5: Subtracting a number from itself
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_number_from_itself
  Description: Check that subtracting a number from itself yields zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose any number for num1 and set num2 to the same value.
  Act: Call subtraction(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the mathematical principle that any number minus itself should equal zero, which is crucial for ensuring accuracy in calculations involving self-referential operations.

#### Scenario 6: Subtracting floating point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_of_floats
  Description: Ensure the function can handle subtraction of floating point numbers accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select two floating-point numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Invoke subtraction(num1, num2).
  Assert: Check that the result is close to the expected value within a reasonable precision.
Validation:
  Floating-point arithmetic is prone to precision issues. This test verifies that the subtraction function can handle floating-point numbers with an acceptable level of accuracy, which is vital in many scientific and financial applications.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `subtraction` function is robust, reliable, and adheres to mathematical standards across a variety of numerical inputs.
