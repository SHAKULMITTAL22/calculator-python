```python
Scenario 1: Standard Integer Division
Details:
  TestName: test_standard_integer_division
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly performs integer division for positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(10, 2).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function handles basic integer division correctly. It confirms that the function adheres to the fundamental division operation.

Scenario 2: Division by One
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_one
  Description: Confirms that dividing by 1 returns the original number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(7, 1).
  Assert: The result should be 7.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test validates that the function does not alter the dividend when the divisor is 1, adhering to mathematical principles.

Scenario 3: Division by Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_negative_number
  Description: Checks that the function correctly handles division where the divisor is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(-10, -2).
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function correctly processes negative numbers according to integer division rules.

Scenario 4: Division of Zero by Another Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_zero
  Description: Verifies that dividing zero by any non-zero number returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(0, 5).
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test confirms that zero divided by any number (except zero) is zero, which is a standard mathematical property.

Scenario 5: Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Ensures that the function returns an error message when attempting to divide by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(9, 0).
  Assert: The result should be "Cannot perform integer division by zero".
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test validates that the function gracefully handles division by zero by returning an appropriate error message, preventing runtime errors.

Scenario 6: Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_large_numbers
  Description: Confirms that the function can handle large positive integers without performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(1000000, 2).
  Assert: The result should be 500000.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function can manage large inputs efficiently, which is crucial for performance in real-world applications.

Scenario 7: Negative Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_large_numbers
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles large negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(-1000000, -2).
  Assert: The result should be 500000.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test confirms that the function handles large negative numbers correctly, which is essential for comprehensive testing of numerical robustness.

Scenario 8: Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly handles floating-point numbers by truncating the result to the nearest integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(7.5, 2.3).
  Assert: The result should be 3.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test validates that the function correctly processes floating-point numbers by truncating the division result, adhering to integer division rules.

Scenario 9: Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_mixed_positive_and_negative_numbers
  Description: Checks that the function correctly handles division where one number is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(-10, 3).
  Assert: The result should be -3.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function correctly processes mixed positive and negative numbers according to integer division rules.

Scenario 10: Edge Case with Maximum Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_with_maximum_integer
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles the maximum integer value in Python.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call integer_division(2147483647, 2).
  Assert: The result should be 1073741823.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function can process the maximum integer value efficiently, confirming its suitability for extreme input values.
