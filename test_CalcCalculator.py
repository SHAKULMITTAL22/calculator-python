================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The division operation does not handle the case where num2 is zero, which can lead to a ZeroDivisionError and potential crash of the application.
Solution: Add a condition to check if num2 is zero before performing the division operation and handle it appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: Although not evident in this snippet, care should be taken to ensure that inputs to the calculator function are sanitized if they come from user input, as they can be vectors for injection attacks in broader contexts.
Solution: Sanitize and validate all user inputs before processing them in the function to ensure they are of the expected type and format.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the types of num1 and num2, which could result in unexpected behavior if the inputs are not numbers.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that num1 and num2 are both numerical values before performing any operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-758: Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior
Issue: The function relies on the behavior of external helper functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) which are not defined in the provided code and may not handle edge cases or errors appropriately.
Solution: Ensure that the helper functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are defined within the code and include proper error handling and edge case management.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: If logging is added in the future, the function's return values and error messages could be logged without proper neutralization, leading to potential log injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure that any logging mechanism used neutralizes special characters in the output to prevent log injection attacks.

  Act: Call the `calculator` function with these numbers and the division operation ('/').
  Assert: Check that the result is "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This test checks the calculator's error handling for division by zero, which is critical for preventing runtime errors.

### Scenario 6: Addition of a Positive and a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_of_positive_and_negative_number
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly adds a positive number and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive number and a negative number, e.g., 5 and -3.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with these numbers and the addition operation ('+').
  Assert: Check that the result is 2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator handles the addition of numbers with different signs correctly.

### Scenario 7: Subtraction Resulting in a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_resulting_in_negative_number
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs subtraction resulting in a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers where the second is larger, e.g., 3 and 5.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with these numbers and the subtraction operation ('-').
  Assert: Check that the result is -2.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the calculator can correctly handle and return negative results from subtraction.

### Scenario 8: Multiplication by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly handles multiplication by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive number and zero, e.g., 7 and 0.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with these numbers and the multiplication operation ('*').
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator correctly implements the property of zero in multiplication.

### Scenario 9: Invalid Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_operation
  Description: Verify that the calculator handles invalid operations appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers and an invalid operation, e.g., 5, 3, and '%'.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with these numbers and the invalid operation.
  Assert: Check that the result is "Invalid operation".
Validation:
  This test checks the calculator's ability to handle and return appropriate error messages for unsupported operations.

### Scenario 10: Addition of Two Negative Numbers
