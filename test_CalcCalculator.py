ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=calculator_ad84dc0779


Scenario 1: Addition Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_addition
  Description: This test verifies that the calculator correctly performs addition when the '+' operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, to be added together.
  Act: Invoke the `calculator` function with `num1`, `num2`, and the '+' operation.
  Assert: Check that the result matches the expected sum of `num1` and `num2`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the calculator correctly delegates the addition operation to the `addition` function, verifying the fundamental arithmetic operation is handled correctly.

Scenario 2: Subtraction Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_subtraction
  Description: This test checks that the calculator performs subtraction correctly when the '-' operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, for subtraction.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with `num1`, `num2`, and the '-' operation.
  Assert: Verify that the result equals the expected difference of `num1` and `num2`.
Validation:
  Confirming correct subtraction ensures that the calculator properly directs to the `subtraction` function, maintaining expected operational integrity.

Scenario 3: Multiplication Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_multiplication
  Description: This test ensures the calculator performs multiplication correctly when the '*' operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, for multiplication.
  Act: Invoke the `calculator` function with `num1`, `num2`, and the '*' operation.
  Assert: Verify that the result equals the expected product of `num1` and `num2`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the calculator accurately uses the `multiplication` function, validating its ability to handle multiplication operations.

Scenario 4: Division Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_division
  Description: This test checks that the calculator correctly performs division when the '/' operation is specified and handles division by non-zero numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, where `num2` is non-zero.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with `num1`, `num2`, and the '/' operation.
  Assert: Verify that the result equals the expected quotient of `num1` divided by `num2`.
Validation:
  Ensures the calculator properly directs to the `division` function and handles division correctly, crucial for accurate mathematical calculations.

Scenario 5: Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_division_by_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the calculator returns an appropriate message when division by zero is attempted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a number `num1` and set `num2` to zero.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with `num1`, `num2`, and the '/' operation.
  Assert: Check that the result is the string "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  Ensures the calculator correctly handles division by zero, a critical edge case, by returning a user-friendly message, preventing runtime errors.

Scenario 6: Invalid Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_invalid_operation
  Description: This test checks that the calculator returns an appropriate message when an invalid operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, and specify an invalid operation, such as '%'.
  Act: Call the `calculator` function with `num1`, `num2`, and the invalid operation.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the string "Invalid operation".
Validation:
  Confirms the calculator's robustness in handling unsupported operations, ensuring it gracefully informs users of invalid input.
