### Scenario 1: Test addition operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_addition
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs addition when the '+' operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the numbers and the '+' operation.
  Assert: Check that the result is the sum of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator delegates to the addition function correctly and handles the '+' operation as expected, fulfilling the basic arithmetic requirement.

### Scenario 2: Test subtraction operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_subtraction
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs subtraction when the '-' operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the numbers and the '-' operation.
  Assert: Check that the result is the difference between num1 and num2.
Validation:
  This test validates that the calculator can handle subtraction, directing to the subtraction function appropriately, which is crucial for performing basic arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 3: Test multiplication operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_multiplication
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs multiplication when the '*' operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the numbers and the '*' operation.
  Assert: Check that the result is the product of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  This test checks if the calculator correctly uses the multiplication function for the '*' operation, ensuring it meets requirements for basic multiplicative operations.

### Scenario 4: Test division operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_division
  Description: Verify that the calculator correctly performs division when the '/' operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, num1 and num2 where num2 is not zero.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the numbers and the '/' operation.
  Assert: Check that the result is the quotient of num1 divided by num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator handles division correctly and uses the division function appropriately, crucial for division operations where the divisor is not zero.

### Scenario 5: Test division by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_division_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the calculator handles division by zero appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, num1 and num2 where num2 is zero.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the numbers and the '/' operation.
  Assert: Check that the result is "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the calculator correctly handles the error case of division by zero, returning a meaningful error message.

### Scenario 6: Test invalid operation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_invalid_operation
  Description: Verify that the calculator returns an error message when an invalid operation is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the numbers and an invalid operation symbol.
  Assert: Check that the result is "Invalid operation".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the calculator can handle unexpected operations gracefully, returning an error message, which is essential for robust error handling in user inputs.

### Scenario 7: Test large number operations
Details:
  TestName: test_calculator_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the calculator can handle very large numbers without overflow or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two very large numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the calculator function with the numbers and each operation ('+', '-', '*', '/').
  Assert: Check that the results are correct for each operation.
Validation:
  Testing with large numbers ensures that the calculator functions correctly under extreme conditions, which is important for reliability and robustness in various use cases.
