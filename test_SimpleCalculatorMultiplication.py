```
Scenario 1: Positive Integers Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the multiplication function correctly handles the product of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication(3, 4).
  Assert: The result should be 12.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of testing positive integers as they are fundamental to basic arithmetic operations and essential for validating the core functionality of the multiplication function.

Scenario 2: Negative Integers Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_negative_integers
  Description: Ensure the multiplication function correctly multiplies two negative integers, resulting in a positive product.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication(-3, -4).
  Assert: The result should be 12.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it verifies the method's capability to handle negative inputs, which is crucial for comprehensive arithmetic validation.

Scenario 3: Positive and Negative Integers Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the multiplication function correctly multiplies a positive integer with a negative integer, resulting in a negative product.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication(3, -4).
  Assert: The result should be -12.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it confirms the function's ability to manage mixed positive and negative integer inputs, ensuring accuracy in various arithmetic scenarios.

Scenario 4: Zero Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_zero
  Description: Check that the multiplication function returns zero when either of the inputs is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication(0, 5).
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function adheres to the mathematical property that any number multiplied by zero is zero, validating edge cases.

Scenario 5: Large Number Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_large_numbers
  Description: Verify the multiplication function correctly handles large positive integers to ensure it can manage substantial numerical values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication(1000000, 1000000).
  Assert: The result should be 1000000000000.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function can handle large inputs without overflow or precision issues, validating its robustness in practical applications.

Scenario 6: Floating Point Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_floating_point
  Description: Ensure the multiplication function correctly multiplies two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication(3.5, 2.0).
  Assert: The result should be 7.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it confirms the function's ability to manage floating-point arithmetic, which is essential for scientific and engineering calculations.

Scenario 7: Mixed Data Type Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_mixed_types
  Description: Verify that the multiplication function appropriately handles multiplication involving a mix of integer and floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication(3, 2.5).
  Assert: The result should be 7.5.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test as it ensures the function can manage mixed data types, reflecting real-world usage where different numerical formats might be involved.
