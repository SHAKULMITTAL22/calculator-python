================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-758
Issue: Syntax error due to improper string literal usage and indentation issues. This can lead to code execution failure and potential undefined behaviors.
Solution: Ensure that proper string literals are used and correct the indentation to follow Python syntax rules.

Vulnerability: CWE-798
Issue: Hardcoded credentials or sensitive information in the code comment. Though the actual code content is minimal, comments should be avoided for sensitive information.
Solution: Remove any sensitive information from comments or use environment variables to handle sensitive data securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-20
Issue: No input validation on the `multiplication` function parameters. This could lead to unexpected behavior if non-numeric inputs are provided.
Solution: Add input validation to ensure that the parameters `num1` and `num2` are numeric before performing multiplication.
