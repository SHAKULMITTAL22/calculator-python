### Scenario 1: Multiplying Two Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., 3 and 4.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 12.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly performs basic multiplication for positive integers, which is a fundamental requirement.

### Scenario 2: Multiplying Two Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., -3 and -4.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 12.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the multiplication of two negative numbers, resulting in a positive product as per mathematical rules.

### Scenario 3: Multiplying a Positive Integer by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the function returns zero when a positive integer is multiplied by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive integer, e.g., 3, and zero.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the rule that any number multiplied by zero results in zero.

### Scenario 4: Multiplying a Negative Integer by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_negative_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the function returns zero when a negative integer is multiplied by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative integer, e.g., -3, and zero.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the multiplication of a negative number by zero, which should also result in zero.

### Scenario 5: Multiplying Positive and Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_and_negative
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies a positive integer by a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive integer, e.g., 3, and a negative integer, e.g., -4.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is -12.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the multiplication of a positive number by a negative number correctly, resulting in a negative product.

### Scenario 6: Multiplying Zero by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_zero_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the function returns zero when zero is multiplied by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two zeros.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the special case of zero multiplied by zero.

### Scenario 7: Multiplying Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two large integers, e.g., 100000 and 200000.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is 20000000000.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly compute the product of large numbers, which is important for scalability and performance.

### Scenario 8: Multiplying Small (Fractional) Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_small_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies small fractional numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two small numbers, e.g., 0.1 and 0.2.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.02.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can accurately handle and compute the product of small fractional numbers, which is crucial for precision in mathematical computations.

### Scenario 9: Multiplying One by Any Number
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_by_one
  Description: Verify that the function returns the other number when one is multiplied by any number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the number 1 and another integer, e.g., 5.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the identity property of multiplication, where any number multiplied by one should return the original number.

### Scenario 10: Multiplying Negative and Positive Fractional Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_negative_and_positive_fractional
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies a negative fractional number by a positive fractional number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative fractional number, e.g., -0.5, and a positive fractional number, e.g., 0.2.
  Act: Call the `multiplication` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the result is -0.1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can accurately compute the product of negative and positive fractional numbers, maintaining precision and correctness.
