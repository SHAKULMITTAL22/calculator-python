Here are several test scenarios designed to validate the `multiplication` function using the `pytest` framework. These scenarios focus on various aspects of the function's behavior, considering different input values and edge cases.

### Scenario 1: Multiplication of Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly multiplies two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., `num1 = 3` and `num2 = 5`.
  Act: Call the function `multiplication(num1, num2)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `15`.
Validation:
  This test is important as it covers the basic use case of multiplying positive integers, which is a common business requirement for any multiplication function.

### Scenario 2: Multiplication by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_by_zero
  Description: Ensure that multiplying any number by zero returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-zero integer, e.g., `num1 = 7`, and set `num2 = 0`.
  Act: Invoke `multiplication(num1, num2)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `0`.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the mathematical property that any number multiplied by zero should be zero, which is crucial for the function's correctness.

### Scenario 3: Multiplication of Negative and Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_negative_and_positive
  Description: Confirm that multiplying a negative integer by a positive integer returns a negative product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `num1 = -4` and `num2 = 6`.
  Act: Execute `multiplication(num1, num2)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `-24`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's handling of sign, ensuring it adheres to mathematical rules regarding negative and positive multiplication.

### Scenario 4: Multiplication of Two Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_two_negatives
  Description: Verify that multiplying two negative integers yields a positive product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = -3` and `num2 = -8`.
  Act: Call `multiplication(num1, num2)`.
  Assert: The expected result should be `24`.
Validation:
  Ensures the function correctly implements the rule that the product of two negatives is positive, maintaining mathematical integrity.

### Scenario 5: Multiplication of Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_large_numbers
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle multiplication of very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose large integers, e.g., `num1 = 10**10` and `num2 = 10**10`.
  Act: Invoke `multiplication(num1, num2)`.
  Assert: The expected result is `10**20`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's performance and correctness when dealing with large numbers, ensuring it doesn't encounter overflow or precision issues.

### Scenario 6: Multiplication of Float Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_floats
  Description: Check if the function accurately multiplies two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two floats, e.g., `num1 = 2.5` and `num2 = 4.0`.
  Act: Execute `multiplication(num1, num2)`.
  Assert: The result should be `10.0`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle floating-point numbers and returns correct results, which is important for applications requiring decimal precision.

### Scenario 7: Multiplication Resulting in Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_resulting_in_zero
  Description: Verify that multiplying two very small float numbers results in zero due to underflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `num1 = 1e-200` and `num2 = 1e-200`.
  Act: Call `multiplication(num1, num2)`.
  Assert: The result should be `0.0`.
Validation:
  Checks the function's behavior with underflow conditions, ensuring it gracefully handles very small values without errors.
