### Scenario 1: Subtracting a Large Number from a Small Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_large_from_small
  Description: Verify that subtracting a significantly larger number from a smaller one yields the correct negative result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` as a small number and `num2` as a significantly larger number.
  Act: Invoke the `subtraction` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is a negative value equal to the difference between `num1` and `num2`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the result is a large negative number, verifying the arithmetic logic of subtraction.

### Scenario 2: Subtracting a Small Fractional Number from a Large Fractional Number

  This test confirms that the function correctly handles operations involving positive and negative fractional numbers, ensuring accurate results.

### Scenario 7: Subtracting Zero from a Large Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_zero_from_large_negative
  Description: Verify that subtracting zero from a large negative number yields the negative number itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` as a large negative number and `num2` as zero.
  Act: Invoke the `subtraction` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is equal to `num1`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where zero is subtracted from a number, verifying that the original number remains unchanged.

### Scenario 8: Subtracting a Large Negative Number from a Small Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_large_negative_from_small_negative
  Description: Verify the function’s ability to handle subtraction where both numbers are negative and `num2` is larger in magnitude than `num1`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize `num1` as a small negative number and `num2` as a large negative number.
