Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers, e.g., num1 = -3, num2 = -8.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is -11.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of correctly adding negative integers to ensure the function's robustness in handling all integer ranges.

  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and a negative integer, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = -4.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 6.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling mixed sign integers to ensure the addition function is versatile and accurate.

### Scenario 4: Adding Zero to an Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an integer and zero, e.g., num1 = 15, num2 = 0.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 15.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the identity property of zero in addition, ensuring the function adheres to basic arithmetic principles.

### Scenario 5: Adding Two Zeros

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the maximum integer values, e.g., num1 = sys.maxsize, num2 = sys.maxsize.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 2 * sys.maxsize.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring the function can handle integer overflow scenarios and large number arithmetic correctly.

### Scenario 8: Adding Minimum Integer Values
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_minimum_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly handles the sum of minimum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the minimum integer values, e.g., num1 = -sys.maxsize - 1, num2 = -sys.maxsize - 1.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is -2 * (sys.maxsize + 1).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring the function can handle large negative integers and potential underflow scenarios.

### Scenario 9: Adding Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating-point numbers, e.g., num1 = 3.5, num2 = 2.1.
  Act: Call the addition function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 5.6.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling floating-point arithmetic to ensure the function's versatility and precision.

### Scenario 10: Adding One Large and One Small Floating Point Number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_and_small_floating_point
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums a large and a small floating-point number.
