```
Scenario 1: Division by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns the appropriate error message when the divisor is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with a non-zero numerator and zero as the denominator.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the string "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  Rationalize: Ensuring that the function handles division by zero gracefully is critical to avoid runtime errors and maintain the stability of the application.

Scenario 2: Valid division with positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_division_positive_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly divide two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with two positive integers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct quotient.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Validating the basic functionality of the function with straightforward, positive numbers ensures that the core division logic works as expected.

Scenario 3: Valid division with negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_division_negative_numbers
  Description: This test ensures that the function can correctly handle the division of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with two negative integers.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct quotient.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Testing with negative numbers confirms that the division logic is not biased towards positive numbers and handles both signs correctly.

Scenario 4: Division with a positive numerator and a negative denominator
Details:
  TestName: test_division_positive_numerator_negative_denominator
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles the division when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with a positive numerator and a negative denominator.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the correct negative quotient.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This scenario ensures that the function treats the signs of the operands appropriately and performs accurate division in mixed-sign scenarios.

Scenario 5: Division with a negative numerator and a positive denominator
Details:
  TestName: test_division_negative_numerator_positive_denominator
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with a negative numerator and a positive denominator.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct negative quotient.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test confirms that the function correctly handles the division of a negative number by a positive number, ensuring proper sign handling.

Scenario 6: Division with very large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_large_numbers
  Description: This test ensures that the function can handle very large numbers without overflow or precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with very large positive integers.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct quotient without any inaccuracies.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Handling large numbers is important for the function's robustness, especially in applications requiring high precision and large datasets.

Scenario 7: Division with very small numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_small_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly divide very small numbers, ensuring precision in the result.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with very small positive floating-point numbers.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the correct quotient with high precision.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Small number division is crucial for scientific and engineering applications, where precision is paramount, ensuring the function meets these requirements.

Scenario 8: Division with identical numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_identical_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when both the numerator and the denominator are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with identical positive integers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This scenario tests a specific edge case where the result of division is trivial, ensuring the function handles such cases correctly.

Scenario 9: Division with non-integer results
Details:
  TestName: test_division_non_integer_results
  Description: This test ensures that the function can handle division resulting in non-integer quotients.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the division function with numbers that result in a non-integer quotient.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the correct floating-point quotient.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Proper handling of non-integer results is essential for the function's versatility, ensuring it can be used in a wide range of mathematical operations.
