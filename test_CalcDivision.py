Scenario 1: Division by a Non-zero Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_non_zero
  Description: Verify that dividing a number by a non-zero number returns the correct quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, where `num2` is non-zero.
  Act: Call the division function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value equals `num1 / num2`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the primary functionality of the division operation is correct and reliable for valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Ensure that dividing any number by zero returns the appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose any number for `num1` and use zero for `num2`.
  Act: Invoke the division function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the string "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This test validates the function's handling of division by zero, an essential check to prevent runtime errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

Scenario 3: Division of Zero by a Non-zero Number
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_divided_by_non_zero
  Description: Confirm that dividing zero by any non-zero number returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1` to zero and `num2` to a non-zero value.
  Act: Call the division function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is 0.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the mathematical rule that zero divided by any non-zero number is zero, ensuring the function adheres to expected arithmetic principles.

Scenario 4: Division of a Positive Number by a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_divided_by_negative
  Description: Check that dividing a positive number by a negative number results in a negative quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a positive value for `num1` and a negative value for `num2`.
  Act: Execute the division function with these values.
  Assert: Ensure the result is negative and equals `num1 / num2`.
Validation:
  This test is vital to confirm that the function correctly handles sign changes in division, maintaining mathematical accuracy.

Scenario 5: Division of Two Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_divided_by_negative
  Description: Verify that dividing a negative number by another negative number yields a positive quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose negative values for both `num1` and `num2`.
  Act: Call the division function with these numbers.
  Assert: Assert that the result is positive and equals `num1 / num2`.
Validation:
  Ensuring correct handling of negative numbers is essential for the function to be robust and versatile across different input ranges.

Scenario 6: Division Resulting in a Fraction
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_fraction
  Description: Confirm that the division function accurately handles cases where the result is a fractional number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use numbers `num1` and `num2` such that `num2` does not evenly divide `num1`.
  Act: Invoke the division function with these inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is a float representing the correct fractional quotient.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's precision and correctness when the division results in a non-integer value, a common requirement in numerical computing.
