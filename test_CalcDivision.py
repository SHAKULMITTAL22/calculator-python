### Test Scenarios for the `division` Function

#### Scenario 1: Normal Division
Details:
  - TestName: test_normal_division
  - Description: Verify that the function correctly divides two positive integers.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, `num1` and `num2`.
  - Act: Call `division(num1, num2)`.
  - Assert: Check that the result matches the expected quotient of `num1 / num2`.
Validation:
  - This test confirms that the basic functionality of dividing two numbers works as expected under normal circumstances.

#### Scenario 2: Division by Zero
Details:
  - TestName: test_division_by_zero
  - Description: Ensure that dividing by zero returns an appropriate error message.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare a numerator and set the denominator to zero.
  - Act: Call `division(num1, 0)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the function returns "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  - This test is crucial as dividing by zero is mathematically undefined and should be handled gracefully by the application to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.

#### Scenario 3: Negative Division
Details:
  - TestName: test_negative_division
  - Description: Check the function's behavior when dividing negative numbers.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Provide a negative number as either the numerator or the denominator.
  - Act: Call `division(num1, num2)` where either `num1` or `num2` is negative.
  - Assert: Confirm that the result is the correct quotient, respecting negative sign rules.
Validation:
  - This test ensures that the division operation correctly handles negative numbers, which is important for the accuracy of mathematical computations in the system.

#### Scenario 4: Division Resulting in Fraction
Details:
  - TestName: test_fractional_result_division
  - Description: Verify that the function can handle division that results in a fractional value accurately.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Choose two numbers where `num1` divided by `num2` results in a fraction (e.g., 1 and 2).
  - Act: Call `division(1, 2)`.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 0.5.
Validation:
  - This test checks the function's ability to handle and return accurate fractional results, which is essential for precision in calculations that require floating-point numbers.

#### Scenario 5: Zero Numerator
Details:
  - TestName: test_zero_numerator_division
  - Description: Test the function when the numerator is zero.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Set `num1` to zero and `num2` to any non-zero integer.
  - Act: Call `division(0, num2)`.
  - Assert: Ensure the result is zero.
Validation:
  - It's important to verify that any number divided by a non-zero number should return zero if the numerator is zero. This test confirms correct behavior in such cases.

#### Scenario 6: Large Number Division
Details:
  - TestName: test_large_number_division
  - Description: Assess the function's ability to handle very large numbers without overflow or errors.
Execution:
  - Arrange: Utilize extremely large values for `num1` and `num2`.
  - Act: Call `division(num1, num2)`.
  - Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct quotient.
Validation:
  - Testing with large numbers ensures that the function can handle high-value computations, which might be critical in scenarios dealing with large datasets or financial calculations.

Each of these scenarios helps ensure that the `division` function behaves correctly across a variety of common and edge cases, thus maintaining reliability and accuracy of the application's numerical calculations.
