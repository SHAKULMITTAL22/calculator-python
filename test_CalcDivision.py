### Scenario 1: Division with two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the division function correctly divides two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., num1 = 8 and num2 = 4.
  Act: Call the division function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 2.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the function handles the basic case of dividing two positive numbers, which is a fundamental operation for the function.

### Scenario 2: Division with a positive numerator and negative denominator
Details:
  TestName: test_division_positive_numerator_negative_denominator
  Description: Ensure that the division function correctly handles division where the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive integer for num1, e.g., 10, and a negative integer for num2, e.g., -2.
  Act: Call the division function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -5.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles sign inversion when dividing by a negative number, which is crucial for correct arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 3: Division by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Test the division function's response when attempting to divide by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to any number, e.g., 5, and num2 to 0.
  Act: Call the division function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This test is critical as it checks the function's ability to handle division by zero, preventing undefined operations and potential crashes, adhering to the function's specification.

### Scenario 4: Division with zero as the numerator
Details:
  TestName: test_division_zero_numerator
  Description: Verify that dividing zero by any non-zero number results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 0 and num2 to any non-zero number, e.g., 7.
  Act: Call the division function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the numerator is zero, which should always result in zero regardless of the denominator (except when it is also zero).

### Scenario 5: Division with two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Ensure the division function correctly divides two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., num1 = -10 and num2 = -2.
  Act: Call the division function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles the division of two negative numbers, particularly that it returns a positive result, which is important for correct mathematical operations.

### Scenario 6: Division with floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_floats
  Description: Verify that the division function can handle floating-point numbers accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two floating-point numbers, e.g., num1 = 9.0 and num2 = 2.0.
  Act: Call the division function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 4.5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately handles floating-point arithmetic, which is essential for applications requiring precise decimal calculations.
