### Test Scenarios for the `division` function

---

**Scenario 1**: Division by a non-zero number
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_valid_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly divides two numbers when `num2` is non-zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide valid values for `num1` and `num2`, e.g., `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 2`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(10, 2)`.
  Assert: Validate the returned result is the correct quotient, e.g., `10 / 2 == 5.0`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that dividing valid numbers is fundamental to the function's business logic, as the goal is to return a correct quotient when possible.
```

---

**Scenario 2**: Division by zero
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Ensure the function handles division by zero correctly by returning the string "Cannot divide by zero".
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a valid value for `num1` and set `num2 = 0`, e.g., `num1 = 5`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(5, 0)`.
  Assert: Validate the returned value is the string "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  Rationalize that division by zero is undefined in mathematics and must be handled explicitly to avoid exceptions. This test guarantees compliance with business requirements for error handling.
```

---

**Scenario 3**: Division resulting in a decimal quotient
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_decimal
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the quotient when division results in a decimal value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide values for `num1` and `num2` where the division does not result in an integer, e.g., `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 4`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(10, 4)`.
  Assert: Validate the returned result matches the expected decimal value, e.g., `10 / 4 == 2.5`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of correctly handling decimal results as part of accurate quotient computation and fulfilling basic division business logic requirements.
```

---

**Scenario 4**: Division by a negative number
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_negative_divisor
  Description: Verify that the function handles division by a negative number correctly, returning a negative quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide valid values for `num1` and `num2` where `num2` is negative, e.g., `num1 = 10` and `num2 = -2`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(10, -2)`.
  Assert: Validate the returned result matches the expected quotient, e.g., `10 / -2 == -5.0`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling negative divisors correctly as part of standard mathematical division behavior.
```

---

**Scenario 5**: Division with negative dividend
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_negative_dividend
  Description: Verify the function supports division when the dividend (`num1`) is negative and produces the correct output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide valid values for `num1` and `num2` where `num1` is negative, e.g., `num1 = -10` and `num2 = 2`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(-10, 2)`.
  Assert: Validate the returned value matches the expected result, e.g., `-10 / 2 == -5.0`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling negative dividends correctly to ensure consistent results for mathematical operations.
```

---

**Scenario 6**: Division resulting in zero quotient
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles cases where the dividend is 0, resulting in a quotient of 0 regardless of the divisor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide valid values for `num1` and `num2` where `num1 = 0` and `num2 > 0`, e.g., `num1 = 0` and `num2 = 5`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(0, 5)`.
  Assert: Validate the returned value matches the expected result, e.g., `0 / 5 == 0.0`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring division behaves consistently when the dividend is zero, a common edge case in mathematical operations.
```

---

**Scenario 7**: Division using large numbers
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_large_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function can handle large numerical inputs correctly without performance or precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide large values for `num1` and `num2`, e.g., `num1 = 10**10` and `num2 = 10**5`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(10**10, 10**5)`.
  Assert: Validate that the returned quotient is correct, e.g., `10**10 / 10**5 == 10**5`.
Validation:
  Rationalize testing with large numbers to verify the robustness and scalability of the function's implementation.
```

---

**Scenario 8**: Division with very small (float) numbers
```
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_small_numbers
  Description: Verify the function handles division involving very small numbers accurately to avoid precision errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide small float values for `num1` and `num2`, e.g., `num1 = 1e-10` and `num2 = 1e-5`.
  Act: Invoke the function with the arguments, e.g., `division(1e-10, 1e-5)`.
  Assert: Validate the returned value matches the expected result, e.g., `1e-10 / 1e-5 == 1e-5`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of verifying precision for small numbers to ensure correctness when handling edge cases in floating-point arithmetic.
```

---

These scenarios collectively evaluate the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the function across a range of inputs and edge cases.
