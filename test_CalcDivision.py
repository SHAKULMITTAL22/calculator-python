Scenario 1: Division by a Non-zero Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_non_zero
  Description: Verify that dividing a number by a non-zero number returns the correct quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers, `num1` as the dividend and `num2` as a non-zero divisor.
  Act: Call the division function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value equals `num1 / num2`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the primary functionality of the division operation is correct and reliable for standard use cases.

Scenario 2: Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Ensure that the function returns an appropriate message when attempting to divide by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a number `num1` and set `num2` to zero.
  Act: Call the division function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the string "Cannot divide by zero".
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to handle division by zero, a common edge case, by returning a meaningful error message instead of crashing or returning an undefined result.

Scenario 3: Division Resulting in a Fraction
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_fraction
  Description: Check that dividing two numbers where the dividend is not a multiple of the divisor returns a fractional result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose `num1` and `num2` such that `num1` is not a multiple of `num2`.
  Act: Call the division function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Ensure the result is a floating-point number representing the correct fractional quotient.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can handle cases where the division does not result in an integer, ensuring accuracy in floating-point arithmetic.

Scenario 4: Division with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function handles division correctly when one or both numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare test cases with different combinations of positive and negative `num1` and `num2`.
  Act: Call the division function with these combinations.
  Assert: Check that the sign of the result is correct and the quotient matches the expected value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly implements the mathematical rules for division involving negative numbers, which is essential for comprehensive functionality.

Scenario 5: Division Resulting in Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_zero
  Description: Confirm that dividing zero by a non-zero number returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1` to zero and `num2` to a non-zero number.
  Act: Call the division function with `num1` and `num2`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test is necessary to validate that the function handles zero as a dividend correctly, adhering to mathematical principles.

Scenario 6: Large Number Division
Details:
  TestName: test_large_number_division
  Description: Assess the function's ability to handle division involving very large numbers without overflow or precision errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select large values for `num1` and `num2`.
  Act: Invoke the division function with these large numbers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is accurate and does not cause overflow.
Validation:
  Testing with large numbers ensures the robustness and scalability of the function, validating its use in scenarios involving high numerical values.
