Certainly! Here are the test scenarios for the `absolute_difference` function using the pytest framework. These scenarios cover various aspects of the function's behavior and logic:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Positive and Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_pos_neg
  Description: Verifies the absolute difference between a positive and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 5 and -3.
  Assert: The result should be 8.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the difference between positive and negative numbers.

Scenario 2: Both Numbers Positive
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_both_pos
  Description: Checks the absolute difference when both numbers are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 10 and 4.
  Assert: The result should be 6.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's behavior with two positive numbers.

Scenario 3: Both Numbers Negative
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_both_neg
  Description: Validates the absolute difference when both numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters -10 and -7.
  Assert: The result should be 3.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles negative numbers.

Scenario 4: Same Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_same_numbers
  Description: Tests the absolute difference when the numbers are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 8 and 8.
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior when the input numbers are identical.

Scenario 5: Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_large_numbers
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior with large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 1000000 and 1.
  Assert: The result should be 999999.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large values correctly.

Scenario 6: Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_floating_point
  Description: Checks the absolute difference with floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 3.5 and 1.2.
  Assert: The result should be 2.3.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to handle floating-point arithmetic.

Scenario 7: One Number is Zero (Positive)
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_one_zero
  Description: Tests the absolute difference when one number is zero (positive).
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 0 and 5.
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the case where one number is zero.

Scenario 8: One Number is Zero (Negative)
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_negative_zero
  Description: Tests the absolute difference when one number is zero (negative).
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters -5 and 0.
  Assert: The result should be 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the case where one number is zero.

Scenario 9: Large Negative and Small Positive
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_large_neg_small_pos
  Description: Verifies the absolute difference with a large negative and a small positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters -1000 and 50.
  Assert: The result should be 1050.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior with a large negative and a small positive number.

Scenario 10: Large Positive and Small Negative
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_large_pos_small_neg
  Description: Verifies the absolute difference with a large positive and a small negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 1000 and -50.
  Assert: The result should be 1050.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior with a large positive and a small negative number.

Scenario 11: Zero and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_both_zero
  Description: Tests the absolute difference when both numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 0 and 0.
  Assert: The result should be 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the scenario where both numbers are zero.

Scenario 12: Negative Large and Large Positive
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_neg_large_pos_large
  Description: Verifies the absolute difference with a negative large number and a positive large number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters -1000000 and 1000000.
  Assert: The result should be 2000000.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior with large negative and positive numbers.

Scenario 13: Mixed Floating-Point and Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_absolute_difference_mixed_floats_int
  Description: Checks the absolute difference with a mix of floating-point and integer numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call absolute_difference with parameters 5.5 and 2.
  Assert: The result should be 3.5.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles mixed input types.
