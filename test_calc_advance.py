Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `exponentiation` function using the pytest framework:

```plaintext
Scenario 1: Positive base and positive exponent
Details:

Validation:
  Rationalize: This test ensures that the function correctly computes the power of positive numbers, confirming basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Positive base and zero exponent
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_base_zero_exponent
  Description: Verify that the function returns 1 when the exponent is zero, regardless of the base.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call exponentiation(5, 0)
  Assert: The result should be 1.
Validation:
  Rationalize: This test checks that any number raised to the power of zero is 1, which is a fundamental property in mathematics.

Scenario 3: Positive base and negative exponent
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_base_negative_exponent
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles negative exponents by returning the reciprocal of the positive exponent result.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call exponentiation(2, -3)
