Here are the test scenarios for the `addition` function, considering the provided constraints:

### Scenario 1: Addition of Two Large Positive Floats
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two large positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum of the two floating-point numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements.

### Scenario 2: Addition of Positive Integer and Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_integer_and_zero
  Description: Verify that adding zero to a positive integer returns the positive integer itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive integer and zero.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the positive integer.
Validation:
  This test confirms that adding zero to any number does not change the number, which is a fundamental property of addition.

### Scenario 3: Addition of Large Negative Float and Large Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_negative_float_and_large_positive_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large negative floating-point number and a large positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large negative floating-point number and a large positive integer.

  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two small negative floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two small negative floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum of the two floats.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles small negative floating-point values, verifying precision and accuracy.

### Scenario 9: Addition of Large Positive Integer and Small Negative Float
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_positive_integer_and_small_negative_float
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large positive integer and a small negative floating-point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large positive integer and a small negative floating-point number.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles mixed sign numbers with significantly different magnitudes.

### Scenario 10: Addition of Two Equal Positive Floats
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_equal_positive_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two equal positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two equal positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct sum, which should be twice the value of one of the floats.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the addition of identical positive floating-point numbers, confirming accuracy.

These scenarios cover a wide range of possible inputs and expected behaviors, ensuring the `addition` function works correctly across various cases.
