### Scenario 1: Adding Two Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers, e.g., num1 = 5, num2 = 7.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 12.
Validation:
  This test is essential because it verifies the core functionality of integer addition, ensuring the basic business logic works correctly for positive integers.

### Scenario 2: Adding Two Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers, e.g., num1 = -3, num2 = -8.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is -11.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the addition of negative numbers, which is a critical aspect of numerical operations.

### Scenario 3: Adding a Positive and a Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_and_negative_integer
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums a positive and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one positive integer and one negative integer, e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = -4.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 6.
Validation:
  This test checks the business logic for mixed-sign integer addition, ensuring that the function can handle cases where the numbers have different signs.

### Scenario 4: Adding Zero to an Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_integer_and_zero
  Description: Verify that adding zero to any integer returns the integer itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an integer and zero, e.g., num1 = 15, num2 = 0.
  Act: Call the addition function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the identity property of addition, which is fundamental to numerical operations.

### Scenario 5: Adding Two Zeros
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_zeros
  Description: Verify that adding zero to zero returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two zeros, e.g., num1 = 0, num2 = 0.
  Act: Call the addition function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 0.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function handles the edge case of adding two zeros correctly.

### Scenario 6: Adding Large Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_integers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large integers, e.g., num1 = 1000000, num2 = 2000000.
  Act: Call the addition function with these integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 3000000.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large integer values without overflow or precision errors.

### Scenario 7: Adding Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums two floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating point numbers, e.g., num1 = 2.5, num2 = 3.7.
  Act: Call the addition function with these floating point numbers.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 6.2.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle floating point arithmetic, which is crucial for many applications involving decimal numbers.

### Scenario 8: Adding Integers and Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_integer_and_floating_point
  Description: Verify that the addition function correctly sums an integer and a floating point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an integer and a floating point number, e.g., num1 = 7, num2 = 2.3.
  Act: Call the addition function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is 9.3.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle mixed-type numerical addition, which is common in real-world applications.
